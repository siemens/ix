# Behavior

Forms behavior refers to the way in which user input is handled and validated within a form. It plays a crucial role in providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for form interactions.

## Validation feedback

When data is validated, a validation result is provided to guide users to correct invalid data, convey a sense of security, warn about critical inputs or inform about special features of an input.

We support 4 types of validation feedback:

1. Valid
2. Info
3. Warning
4. Invalid

## Form submission strategies

When it comes to handling form submissions, there are three common strategies to ensure a seamless user experience and maintain data integrity:

1. Disable submit button
2. Always enable submit button
3. Submit on blur

A combination of strategy 1 and 3 is possible.

### Strategy 1: Disable submit button

In this strategy, the submit button is disabled until all required input controls are filled or controls are valid. This helps prevent users from submitting invalid data to the server.

- Pro: Prevents sending invalid data to the server.
- Pro: Communicates issues with the form.
- Con: Doesn't specify missing or incorrect fields which can be frustrating.
- Con: Some screen readers may not read out the disabled submit button, causing confusion.

### Strategy 2: Always enable submit button

In this strategy, the submit button is always enabled, allowing users to click it at any time.

- Pro: Users can always click the submit button and receive feedback on missing or invalid data.
- Con: The form may appear complete even with missing or invalid data.
- Con: Unnecessary data may be sent to the server, consuming resources.

### Strategy 3: Submit on blur

In this strategy, there is no need for a submit button. The form is automatically submitted after the user finishes inputting and leaves the control.

- Pro: Provides a seamless user experience by automatically submitting the form when the user moves away from a field.
- Pro: Provides immediate feedback without the need for a submit button.
- Con: Users may accidentally trigger form submission by navigating away from a field unintentionally.
- Con: Handling validation and error messages without a submit button can be challenging.
- Con: Users may not have a chance to review and confirm their input before submission.
