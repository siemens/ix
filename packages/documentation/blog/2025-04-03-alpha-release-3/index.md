# Update Angular version and support standalone components

![Angular standalone](./angular.png)

**Exciting updates** have been made to our Angular support, enhancing compatibility and ease of use for developers.

**Key changes:**

- **Minimum Angular version:** The minimum supported Angular version has been updated to version 18.
- **Support standalone components:** We now support Angular standalone components out of the box.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { IxButton } from '@siemens/ix-angular/standalone';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-example',
  imports: [IxButton],
  template: `
    <ix-button>Button</ix-button>
    <ix-button disabled>Button</ix-button>
  `,
})
export default class Buttons {}
```

Standalone components offer a more straightforward approach to developing Angular applications. By utilizing standalone components, directives, and pipes, developers can enhance the authoring experience and minimize reliance on NgModules.

# Global CSS Changes

![global style changes](./css.png)

To avoid style collisions with other CSS frameworks or libraries, a prefix has been added to some global styles such as table, input, and label.

**Key changes**:

- **Input and textarea**: Global styling has been prevented. To use legacy styling, add `class="ix-form-control"` to input or textarea.
- **Label**: Global styling has been prevented. To use legacy styling, add `class="ix-form-label"` to label.
- **Table**: New global classes `.ix-table` and `.ix-table-striped` have been added to display a simple HTML table. These changes aim to enhance compatibility and prevent conflicts in styling across different frameworks and libraries.

# Bootstrap is removed from our dependencies

![remove bootstrap](./bootstrap.png)

The CSS framework Bootstrap has been removed from our main style file, marking a significant change in our approach to styling.

**Key changes:**

- **Bootstrap removal:** The third-party CSS framework Bootstrap has been completely removed from our style file.

**Why this is beneficial:**

- **Reduced dependency:** Removing Bootstrap reduces dependency on third-party frameworks, leading to fewer compatibility issues and conflicts with other libraries.
- **Improved performance:** Without the additional overhead of Bootstrap, the overall performance and loading times of our applications can improve.
- **Customization and control:** This change allows for greater customization and control over the styling, enabling more tailored and specific design choices that align with our unique requirements.

# Input validation enhancements

![input validation](./input-validation.png)

Input elements have been updated to improve user experience by preventing required validation errors from appearing without any user interaction.

**Key changes:**

- **Input elements affected:** ix-input, ix-number-input, ix-date-input, ix-select, and ix-textarea will no longer show required validation errors unless there has been user interaction.
- **Programmatic validation:** If the class ix-invalid is applied programmatically, an error message will still be shown even without user interaction.

# Date picker enhancements

![date picker](./picker.png)

Week numbers are now hidden by default in several date-related components, enhancing the user interface and simplifying the display.

**Key changes:**

**ix-date-picker**: Week numbers are hidden by default. To show them, set `showWeekNumbers` to true.
**ix-datetime-picker**: Week numbers are hidden by default. To show them, set `showWeekNumbers` to true.
**ix-date-dropdown**: Week numbers are hidden by default. To show them, set `showWeekNumbers` to true.
**ix-date-input**: Week numbers are hidden by default. To show them, set `showWeekNumbers` to true.
