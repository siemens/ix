Design your commands for humans. Have a conversation. Speak the Siemens brand: Authentic, open and engaging.

- Offer interactive modes when developing primarily for human interaction
- Tell users which environment they are in (interactive / non-interactive)  
- Use --no-input when you don't want to interact with your terminal
- Ensure users can exit anytime
