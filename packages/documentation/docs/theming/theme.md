# Themes

Siemens iX supports theming for all of its components.

Everyone can use the two embedded themes that already ship with Siemens iX:

- Classic light (theme-classic-light)
- Classic dark (theme-classic-dark)

You can also create your own themes in order to customize the design system to your own brand.

Siemens AG applications should utilize the exclusive Siemens AG Corporate Brand Theme.

## How to set a theme

The default theme is `theme-classic-dark`. To set a different theme change the `class` attribute of the `<body>` tag to contain e.g. `theme-classic-light` instead of `theme-classic-dark`.

```html
<html>
  <!-- Framework related imports -->
  <!--  -->
  <body class="theme-classic-light"></body>
</html>
```

## Siemens AG Corporate Brand Theme

<div class="siemens-brand-section">

The Siemens AG Corporate Brand Theme is exclusively available to official Siemens AG products where it should always be used as the default theme to reflect the latest Siemens AG Corporate Brand guidelines.
