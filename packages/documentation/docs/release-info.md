# Siemens Industrial Experience versioning and releases

<p className="text-l-title">
Our Siemens Industrial Experience design team strive to provide a stable and reliable system that's constantly evolving to meet your needs. This section describes our practices for new features and changes, deprecating and removing outdated features, and our long-term support for older versions. 
</p>

### Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases. Version numbers indicate the level of changes introduced by the release and follow the standard major, minor and patch format.

| Release type        | Details                                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Major               | Contains significant new features and changes, might include breaking changes. Updating requires some developer efforts and includes backward incompatible changes to APIs, file paths, component behavior and/or dependencies. Formerly deprecated components are removed when updating to a new major version. |
| Minor               | Contains smaller features and changes. Updating requires no developer efforts. Minor versions can include components changing their status to deprecated. They are fully backward compatible. |
| Patch               | Contains bug fixes. Updating requires no developer efforts. |

### Release frequency

We follow a time-based release schedule consisting of:
- One major release every 6 months
- 1-3 minor releases for each major release
- Patch releases as hotfixes when necessary

### Support policy

All major releases receive support for approximately 12 months. We distinguish between two support stages for major releases:

| Support stage           | Support window | Details                                       |
|-------------------------|:--------------:|-----------------------------------------------|
| Active                  | 6 months       | Receive regular minor releases                |
| Long-term support (LTS) | 6 months       | Receive patch releases to fix critical issues |

Our support policy applies to all components of the design system including the code base, Figma design kits and our documentation. 

We recommend always following the active release. When a version moves from the active stage to the LTS stage, projects should start migrating to the new active major version. 

### Supported versions
