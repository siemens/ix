### Changing Theme Variables

To modify the colors and other values of a theme within the Figma Siemens Brand library, follow these steps:  

1. Import the "iX Foundation" file into your Figma workspace.
2. In the top-right corner of the Figma interface, you'll find a button labeled "Open settings" with a settings icon. Click on it to open the variables dialog.
3. Within the variables dialog, navigate to the desired collection, such as the "iX Semantic colors" collection located at the top-left corner.
4. From there, you can easily change the values of the variables to adjust the appearance of the theme.
5. The different themes are organized into columns, allowing you to switch between them effortlessly.

### Selecting a Theme for Designing

When working with the Figma Siemens Brand library, you can apply a theme to either an entire page or an individual element, such as a frame or component:  

#### Applying a Theme to a Page

1. Ensure that no elements are selected on the page. If any elements are selected, press the "Esc" key to deselect them.
2. In the right panel of the Figma interface, locate the "Page" section.
3. On the right side of the "Page" section, you'll find a button with a hexagon symbol. Click on it to open the theme selection dropdown.
4. From the dropdown, you can select the desired theme colors to apply them to the entire page.  

#### Applying a Theme to an Element

1. Select the specific element, such as a frame or component, to which you want to apply a theme.
2. In the right panel of the Figma interface, find the "Layer" section.
3. Within the "Layer" section, you'll find a button with a hexagon symbol. Click on it to open the theme selection dropdown.
4. From the dropdown, you can choose the desired theme colors to apply them to the selected element. 

Remember, when you apply a theme to an individual element, it will override the page-level theme.
