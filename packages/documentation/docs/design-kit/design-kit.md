Get access to our Siemens Industrial Experience Design System here. The official release of our Figma library is out now and available for Siemens employees and business partners. Furthermore, there are two Sketch libraries available. One with brand elements only accessible to Siemens employees and business partners and another one with open-source specs. Please bear in mind we changed our workflow to Figma, the Sketch files will not be updated anymore.
