The different themes are organized into columns, allowing you to switch between them effortlessly.

# Selecting a Theme for Designing

When working with the Figma Siemens Brand library, you can apply a theme to either an entire page or an individual element, such as a frame or component:

## Applying a Theme to a whole Page

Ensure that no elements are selected on the page. If any elements are selected, press the "Esc" key to deselect them.
1. In the right panel, you'll find a button with a hexagon symbol on the right side of the "Page" section. Click on it to open the theme selection dropdown.
2. From the dropdown, you can select the desired theme colors to apply them to the entire page.  

## Applying a Theme to an Element

Select the specific element, such as a frame or component, to which you want to apply a theme.
1. In the right panel, you'll find a button with a hexagon symbol on the right side of the "Layer" section. Click on it to open the theme selection dropdown.
2. From the dropdown, you can choose the desired theme colors to apply them to the selected element. 

Remember, when you apply a theme to an individual element, it will override the page-level theme.
