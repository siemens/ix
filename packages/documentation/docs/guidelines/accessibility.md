## Our commitment as a design system

- We are committed that our deliverables qualify for building solutions that are accessible for everyone.
- We strive to meet WCAG AA standards with providing perceivable, operable, and understandable components that follow our accessibility checklist.

## Ensuring accessibility in products

- While our components are designed to meet accessibility standards, it is essential to remember that the overall accessibility of your solutions depends on how these components are used.
- Simply incorporating our accessible components does not guarantee that the final product will be fully accessible.
- It is the responsibility of the developers and designers to ensure that their implementations adhere to accessibility best practices throughout the entire design and development process.
- A comprehensible quick reference on how to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can be found here.

## WCAG

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG covers web sites, applications, and other digital content. It is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). WCAG is an international standard.
- There are three levels of conformance:
  - Level A is the minimum level.
  - Level AA includes all Level A and AA requirements. Many organizations strive to meet Level AA.
  - Level AAA includes all Level A, AA, and AAA requirements.
