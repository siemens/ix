## Guiding principles for excellent design
We've refined our approach into four core design principles to help you make your applications intuitive, efficient and valuable.
- **Simplify for clarity**: We make it easier for our users to handle industrial complexity.
- **Design for flexibility**: We create interfaces that adapt seamlessly to our users in their industrial environment.
- **Empower users**: We use technology to assist our users and accelerate their industrial workflows.
- **Build for humans**: We strive to create products that are beneficial to our users in the industrial ecosphere and to society at large.

As we’re constantly improving our design system for you, we’ll soon offer more detailed information on how to work with these principles in your everyday design activities.
