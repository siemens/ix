## Jargon, buzz words and terms

- Use simple vocabulary

- Do not avoid technical terms but consider if you need to explain them

- Define new or unfamiliar terms and use existing explanations (do not reinvent the wheel)

## Abbreviations and acronyms

- Avoid abbreviations (info, incl, excl) and acronyms (SIOS for Siemens Industry Online Support)

- Explain acronyms initially and in full unless well known: Asset Performance Suite (APS)

- Capitalization only for acronyms that are proper nouns

- No periods in abbreviations or acronyms

- Never make up your own acronyms: https://www.acronymfinder.com/

## Time based vocabulary: Last, latest and recent

- Last implies nothing else will follow. It's the last, and after this it is finished. No more are coming.

- Latest implies that it is the last to date, which means there could be more to follow. Most recent. Newest.

- Recent is more time focused and is similar to latest. It means that it happened a short time ago.
