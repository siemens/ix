## Capitalize proper nouns

- A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or object that is spelled with a capital letter

- Examples of proper nouns in English are Jennie, Edinburgh, and Digital Enterprise Labs

- In contrast, a common noun is a noun that is the name of a group of similar things, such as "pump" or "valve", and not of a single person, place, or thing and is not capitalized

- In the context of industrial applications, proper nouns might be company and product names, tools or existing technical and legal terms

- Avoid making up your own proper nouns, e.g. ball valve instead of Ball Valve
