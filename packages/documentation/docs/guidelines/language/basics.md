import Guideline from '@site/src/components/Guideline';


The following sections contain advice we follow at Siemens to create our own products and includes common writing errors to avoid when creating industrial products and experiences.

### Style

- Use as few words as possible

- Use simple, specific, clear, and informative wording

- Use the same words and grammatical forms, lengths, and styles repeatedly

### Tone and voice

- Use natural, conversational language and not robotic, funny, cool or clever

- Address users in second-person (you) and use first-person plural for the application (we)

- Use gender-neutral language

- Use polite language

- Use 'please' and 'sorry' only when necessary, for something inconvenient or unplanned

- Use positive instead of negative framing

- Use positive contractions to avoid sounding too formal

- Avoid using negative contractions as they can appear too informal

### Length

- Use sentences only when necessary

- Use short words (3, 4, or 5 letters) instead of long words (8 or longer)

- Use short, scannable segments, not paragraphs

- Keep sentences under 25 words (average = 15 words)

- Keep titles under 65 characters (including spaces)

- Use info icons only when necessary: Icons cannot contain the same content as the UI

### Use of big and small letters (capitalization/casing)

- Capitalize the first letter of the first word in a title / sentence / tooltip / menu item / list item / button

- Capitalize proper nouns, i.e. places, organizations, tools, languages, products and things: Siemens, SIMATIC PCS myexpert, iOS, JavaScript, MindSphere

- Capitalize named app functions and UI elements: Go to Settings, Allocate users in User management, Press Ok
