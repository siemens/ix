## Examples 

![Acknowledging users example 1](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4329&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4) 

![Acknowledging users example 2](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4401&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

In all these examples, the chatbot acknowledges the input and then continues with its response, building user confidence that the chatbot understood their query correctly.

Here, although there may be some lag time between the query and the response, the chatbot acknowledges the request and then signals they are working on the task. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use discourse markers to acknowledge users (see grammar section)  
-	Do use interim acknowledgments if the query response takes time to load  
-	Do read out dialogs to test if any acknowledgments are naturally missing  
-	Don’t forget to balance efficiency with authenticity
