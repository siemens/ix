# Natural language

## Overview
Even in industrial contexts, chatbots or virtual assistants have to interact with their users in a human way. They have to understand the language used by users and respond naturally and appropriately for the industrial situation. We want our industrial chatbots to respond as an industrial expert, similar to a colleague they trust, to get our users the information they need. 

## Benefits for industrial chatbots

**Positive user experience:** Users prefer chatbots that feel like real conversations, making the experience more comfortable, engaging and personal.

- **Do**

**Chatbot:** Hello! I’m your Industrial Copilot. What can I help you with today?

- **Don’t**

 **Chatbot:** Welcome to your online support system. Please enter your request below. *(Talks in a robotic unnatural way)*  

**Engaging interaction:** When users feel the chatbot is responding naturally, like a person would when trying to assist them with a task, users are much more forgiving if it takes longer to reach their requested goal.

- **Do**

**User:** Hi! Can you help me with something?   
**Chatbot:** Of course, that’s what I’m here for! How can I help?

- **Don’t**

**User:** Hi! Can you help me with something?   
**Chatbot:** Hello. I can support you with engineering and accessing user manuals. Choose one option to continue. *(Limits conversation and interaction)*

**Situational appropriacy:** When chatbots understand and respond within the user’s context, such as a worker on a factory assembly line, there’s a higher chance they can provide the right answers and respond correctly to user input.

- **Do** 

**User:** Hi! Can you help me find a replacement valve, stock number 26259, in our online stock. 
**Chatbot:** Absolutely! Do you want me to check the online stock for only this factory or for all your factories worldwide? 

- **Don’t**

**User:** Hi! Can you help me find a replacement valve, stock number 26259, in our online stock?
 **Chatbot:** I apologize but I do not have access to your specific stock situation. As an AI chatbot, I am constantly learning. If there is anything else you need help with, please ask. *(Does not understand intent or user context)*

**Brand extension:** As the language a chatbot uses is an extension of your brand, its voice must reflect and align with your brand. Being conversational and friendly - instead of robotic and cold - helps brand loyalty and creates a positive brand experience.

- **Do**
 
**User:** Hello, I’d like to check my software expiry dates.  
**Chatbot:** Absolutely! Which software licenses would you like me to check for you?

- **Don’t**

**User:** Hello, I’d like to check my software expiry dates.   
**Chatbot:** Please provide a list of the software licenses you would like me to check for their expiry dates. *(Generic response)*

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a field of computer science and a branch of artificial intelligence. It focuses on the interaction between computers and humans and creates models of human language. This helps enable a more natural and human interaction between users and machines. For industrial chatbots, NLP models and software learn from user input to develop and become better at understanding user requests, thus supporting them more efficiently in their daily work.

### Benefits of NLP

**Understand contextual awareness:** NLP chatbots understand user context, allowing them to provide relevant and accurate responses.

**Interpret user input:** NLP chatbots are able to interpret user intent and respond suitably.    

**Provide intuitive interactions:** NLP chatbots can better understand and respond to natural language, improving the user experience.  

**Manage deviations:** NLP chatbots recognize nuances and variation in user language and adapt to different queries.

**Offer multilingual support:** NLP chatbots understand and answer in multiple languages to support global industries.
