# System personas

## Overview

System personas refer to the personality of the chatbot. This includes its character, voice and how the chatbot responds and interacts with its users. System personas act as an extension of the company brand and should exhibit the same character traits. If your brand represents trustworthiness, creativity and authenticity, your chatbot should be prompted to respond in a way that reflects these characteristics. Without system prompting or a rounded personality, your chatbot may respond in a way that damages your brand and adds frustration and dissatisfaction to your customers. A good persona makes interactions with customers and users more enjoyable and engaging, thus boosting brand satisfaction. 

## Creating personas

Follow these steps and answer the questions with your team to create your system persona:

1. **Brainstorm essential features**
   - What's their profession?
   - What's their education level?
   - Do they have a gender?
   - What languages do they speak?

2. **List key adjectives**
   - Create a list of 5 key adjectives to describe your chatbot's character (for industrial chatbots, we recommend professional, efficient, empathetic, helpful, polite). 
   - Are these adjectives aligned with our brand? 
   - Are these adjectives clear and easy to comprehend?  

3. **Name your chatbot to reflect your brand**
   - Do we want a human name? 
   - Do we want a robotic or technical name? 
   - Is this a unique name? 
   - Does it have any cultural or language concerns with regard to meaning? 
   - Does it sound good when we say it aloud? 
   - Does the name match the chatbot character and its essential features? 
   - Does it match the use case and industry?

4. **Design your chatbot icon**
   - Should we use a robot or a person icon? 
   - Does this icon align with our brand? 
   - Is the icon simple and flexible enough for all device types, contexts and sizes? 

5. **Define the tone of voice**
   - Is your chatbot friendly, conversational, formal, humorous, direct, intimate, respectful, serious or casual?

6. **Select system prompts**
   - Choose prompts from templates that match your persona. 
   - Keep your persona concise using not more than a page of prompts.
   - Which prompts match our use case and context? 
   - Which prompts are essential? 
   - Which prompts are irrelevant? 
   - Which prompts would be nice to have?
 
7. **Create sample dialogs**

8. **Carry out iterative testing**

## System persona prompts

### Getting started

We’ve created multiple system persona templates for you to create industrial chatbots. Adapt the templates to your own users and context by taking as many of the prompts as required for your own applications.

There are two persona templates: a basic set of prompts and an exhaustive set of prompts. The basic template has essential information including name, profession and personality to be used to prompt simple chatbots. The second template has much more detailed and comprehensive prompts for a more rounded and extensive chatbot persona. We recommend every application has at least the basic prompts, however, we do not recommend using all the prompts here. Consider not having more than a page of prompts.

3. You have a very specific use case for your chatbot, e.g. accessing documentation.
4. Your chatbot interacts with experts and acts as an expert.
5. Your chatbot supports English user input.
