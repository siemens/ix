# System personas

## Overview

System personas refer to the personality of the chatbot. This includes its character, voice and how the chatbot responds and interacts with its users. System personas act as an extension of the company brand and should exhibit the same character traits. If your brand represents trustworthiness, creativity and authenticity, your chatbot should be prompted to respond in a way that reflects these characteristics. Without system prompting or a rounded personality, your chatbot may respond in a way that damages your brand and adds frustration and dissatisfaction to your customers. A good persona makes interactions with customers and users more enjoyable and engaging, thus boosting brand satisfaction. 

## Creating personas 

Follow these steps and answer these questions with your team to create your system persona:

**1.**	**Brainstorm essential features of your chatbot:**   
- What’s the chatbot’s profession?   
- What’s the chatbot’s education level?   
- Does your chatbot have a gender?   
- What languages does your chatbot speak?   


**2.	Create a list of 5 key adjectives to describe your chatbot’s character:**  
- Are these adjectives aligned with our brand?   
- Are these adjectives clear and easy to comprehend?  

**Recommendation:** For our Siemens industrial chatbots we use professional, efficient, empathetic, helpful and polite. 

**3.	Name your chatbot to reflect your brand:**   
- Do we want a human name?   
- Do we want a robotic or technical name?   
- Is this a unique name?   
- Does it have any cultural or language concerns with regard to meaning?   
- Does it sound good when we say it aloud?   
- Does the name match the chatbot’s character and its essential features?   
- Does it match the use case and industry?  

**Recommendation:** For our Siemens industrial chatbots, they are often simply called “Industrial Copilot”    

**4.	Design your chatbot icon:**   
- Should we use a robot or a person icon?   
- Does this icon align with our brand?   
- Is the icon simple and flexible enough for all device types, contexts and sizes?  

**5.	Decide on your chatbot’s tone of voice:**   
- Is it friendly? Conversational? Formal? Humorous? Direct? Intimate? Respectful? Serious? Casual? 

**6.	Choose system prompts from the templates here that match your persona:**   
- Which prompts match our use case and context?   
- Which prompts are essential?   
- Which prompts would be nice to have?   
- Which prompts are irrelevant to our chatbot?    

**Recommendation:** For industrial chatbots we recommend not more than 20 prompts. However, for chatbots with specific security risks, more than 20 prompts may be needed. 

**7.	Create sample dialogs**   

**8.	Carry out iterative testing** 



## System persona prompts

### Getting started

We’ve created multiple system persona templates for you to create industrial chatbots. Adapt the templates to your own users and context by taking as many of the prompts as required for your own applications.

There are two persona templates: a basic set of prompts and an exhaustive set of prompts. The basic template has essential information including name, profession and personality to be used to prompt simple chatbots. The second template has much more detailed and comprehensive prompts for a more rounded and extensive chatbot persona. We recommend every application has at least the basic prompts, however, we do not recommend using all the prompts here. Consider not having more than a page of prompts. 

### Assumptions

2. You are creating a chatbot that has access to specific [Company Name] resources you have provided (not the entire web).
3. You have a very specific use case for your chatbot, e.g. accessing documentation.
4. Your chatbot interacts with experts and acts as an expert.
5. Your chatbot supports English user input.
