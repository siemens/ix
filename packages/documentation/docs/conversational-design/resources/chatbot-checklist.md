# Chatbot checklist

## Assumptions

1. You are creating an industrial chatbot with a specific use case such as customer support, maintenance scheduling, information resource, engineering or spare-part replacement.
2. You have an established brand voice and tone.
3. Your team has the required domain-specific and user knowledge.
4. You work in a team with developers, designers, and writers.
5. You test continuously or iteratively.

### Follow these steps and answer the questions with your teams to create your industrial chatbot

**1. Define your industrial use case**
   - What is the purpose and scope of the chatbot?
   - Which resources does it need to access?
   - What constraints or limitations does it have?

**2. Create your system persona** (follow our steps)

**3. Decide on the right technology stack**
   - Which technology is most appropriate? Consider programming language, framework, NLP model/tools and deployment options.

**4. Create user journeys**
   - Where is our chatbot used inside the user workflow?
   - What is the intent of our users? Use sample dialogs to clarify explicit and implicit intent.

**5. Develop chatbot with your technology stack**
   - How does the chatbot integrate into existing systems?
   - How does the chatbot scale as use cases increase?
   - How do we implement authentication and authorization with various user roles?

**6. Train your chatbot**
   - How do we gather relevant industry-specific data?
   - How do we annotate our data?
   - How do we monitor and update our chatbot?

**7. Test your chatbot**
   - Does the chatbot respond with natural language? Assess NLP model and tool.
   - Does the chatbot use your brand's voice and tone?
   - Does it respond appropriately? Test error handling, task efficiency, and handling vague requests.
   - How do we collect user feedback? Consider rating systems, post-query surveys.
   - How do we assess the chatbot's performance? Consider response time, accuracy, successful/abandoned interactions.

## Dos and Don'ts
- Do work with all stakeholders to ensure transparency
- Do customize chatbot responses for project-specific terminology and processes
- Do consider how your chatbot hands off to humans for complex issues
- Do read and review interactions (with user consent)
- Don't assume all chatbot interactions are successful
- Don't forget to retrain, test and update your chatbot
