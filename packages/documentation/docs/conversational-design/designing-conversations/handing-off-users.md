# Handing off users 
## Overview 

Chatbots must hand off their users whenever they’ve failed to clarify what the user wants or reach an accurate response. They should never continue to ask questions, clarify or funnel more than 3 times before handing users off to an alternative support system. 

## Examples

![Handing off to human assistance example](https://www.figma.com/design/wEptRgAezDU1z80Cn3eZ0o/iX-Pattern-Illustrations?node-id=3218-4347&t=etx1DcSbA7VDx5xD-4)

Here the chatbot is polite, professional and after a couple of clarifying questions, they admit to being unable to help and hand them off the best person to support them with their issue. They also make it clear they are being handed off to a human. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do ensure support features are current and live   
- Do be transparent when your chatbot is handing users over    
-	Don’t try more than 3 times to ask for clarification; know when to hand off
