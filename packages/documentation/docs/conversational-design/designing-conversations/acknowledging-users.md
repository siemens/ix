# Acknowledging users 
## Overview 

In conversations, humans like to be acknowledged to shows the other person is listening and understands the situation. When a chatbot acknowledges user input, it prompts users to continue interacting, boosts the overall user experience, and makes interactions more authentic. 
## Examples 

**User:** Can you provide more details about our pricing plans?  
**Chatbot:** Certainly! We have three pricing tiers: Basic, Premium, and Enterprise.

**User:** Is there a trial period for your software?  
**Chatbot:** Of course! You can try our software free for 14 days.

**User:** Can I customize the dashboard layout?  
**Chatbot:** Absolutely! You can rearrange widgets and choose your preferred layout.

In all these examples, the chatbot acknowledges the input and then continues with its response, building user confidence that the chatbot understood their query correctly. 

**User:** Can you create a maintenance schedule in August for all ball valves within the refinery located in Hamburg?   
**Chatbot:** Sure. Give me a moment. 

Here, although there may be some lag time between the query and the response, the chatbot acknowledges the request and then signals they are working on the task. 

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use discourse markers to acknowledge users (see grammar section)  
-	Do use interim acknowledgments if the query response takes time to load  
-	Do read out dialogs to test if any acknowledgments are naturally missing  
-	Don’t forget to balance efficiency with authenticity
