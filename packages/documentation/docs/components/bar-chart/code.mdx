## Development

### Basic

Common bar charts normally compare the values of different categories where the length of the bars are proportional to their values.

<EchartsBarSimplePlayground height="40rem" />

### Stacked bar chart

Stacked bar charts are typically used to visualize the relationship between the parts and the whole. Each bar is divided into segments, with each segment representing a different category.

<EchartsBarHorizontalStackedPlayground height="40rem" />

### Dos and Don'ts

- Do start the Y-axis at zero and label axes clearly
- Do use short and clear category names
- Do include context and additional information when necessary
- Do arrange categories and bars in a logical order
- Don’t use too many bars in one chart
- Don’t overcrowd charts with colors and categories, especially the stacked variant
- Don’t use stacked bars if the total value is not important
