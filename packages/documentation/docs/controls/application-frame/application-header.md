# Header

<Tags />

When working with the ix-application-header component, you have the flexibility to position elements within its content area. The content area is specifically aligned to the right side of the header, allowing you to strategically place and organize various elements.

## Usage

TODO: React, Angular and Vue Example

<Playground name="application-header" examplesByName noMargin height="18rem"></Playground>

### Avatar

Enhance the interactivity of your `ix-application-header` by placing the ix-avatar component as part of the content. This not only makes the avatar clickable but also enables the addition of `ix-dropdown-item`'s directly within the `ix-avatar` component.
