# Application
<Tags />

The ix-application component acts as a centralized hub for configuring aspects of your web-application, such as screen breakpoints, theming and  app switch configuration. By consolidating these configuration points, it simplifies the management of application-wide settings and ensures a consistent user interface across different scenarios.

The component itself is designed with modularity in mind. It can be seamlessly integrated with other components such as ix-application-header, ix-menu, ix-content, and more. This modular approach allows you to mix and match components based on your specific application requirements, providing flexibility and customization options.

It's important to note that the ix-application component focuses solely on layouting and does not dictate visual design.

## Example

The code snippet blow shows an example of a combination of different components like `ix-application-header` or `ix-content`.

### App switch

The navigation to another application is implemented via `window.open` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open). Therefore you can control if the navigation should happen inside the current browser context `target: '_self'` or inside a new tab `target: '_blank'` (more information about target can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target))

```javascript
  {
    id: 'demo-app-2',
    name: 'Calculator App',
    description: 'Example description for floor app',
    iconSrc: '...url to some icon',

    url: '...target url',
    target: '_self', // Define the navigation context (e.g current browser context or new tab)
  }
```
