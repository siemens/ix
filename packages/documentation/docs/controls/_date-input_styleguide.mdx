The date input component enables users to enter and select a date in a standardized format. We typically use this component in forms, calendars, and scheduling tools to ensure consistent and accurate date entries.

## Options

- **Label**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Value**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Required**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Helper text**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Feedback text**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Show text as tooltip**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md)
- **Placeholder**: See [form field](./forms/forms-field.md). We typically use a placeholder to show an example date format to assist users when the field is empty.
- **Error message**: Feedback text when date is not parsable. We typically use this to inform users that the entered date format is incorrect and guide them to enter a valid date.
- **Format**: Specify the date format, default ‘yyyy/LL/dd’. We typically use this to ensure that dates are entered in a consistent and recognizable format, leveraging the Luxon JavaScript library for parsing and formatting.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction**:
  - Click or focus opens date picker.
  - Use mouse or keyboard arrows to navigate to desired date.
  - Selecting a date in date picker with mouse click or enter closes the date picker.
  - Typing a date into input field with valid format closes the date picker.
  - Escape key closes the date picker.
- **Validation**:
  - Use feedback text for validation types valid, info, warning and invalid.
  - Invalid feedback automatically provided if entered date in not parsable.
  - Refer to the [validation](./forms/forms-validation.md) chapter for detailed guidelines.
- **Overflow**: The input field should be wide enough to display the full date without truncation.
- **Alignment**: Date inputs are always aligned to the left.

## States

Date input has five states: Default, hover, disabled, read-only and focused.

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use consistent date formats: Ensure the date format is uniform throughout the application to avoid confusion
- Do use separate inputs for date ranges: Provide distinct input fields for the start and end dates to make it easier for users to enter and understand date ranges
- Do provide clear instructions: Clearly indicate the required date format to users. For example, “Please enter the date in yyyy-MM-dd format”
- Do handle time zones: If time zones are relevant, ensure that the date input accounts for them and is clearly labeled
- Do consider localization: Adapt date formats to the local conventions of your users if your application is used internationally
- Don't use ambiguous formats: Do not use date formats that can be easily misinterpreted, such as 09/08/2006 without clear context
- Don't allow free text without validation: Avoid allowing users to enter dates as free text without any validation or formatting guidance
