Dropdowns are elements that reveal an menu with additional items once a user clicks or hovers over the top-level element e.g. dropdown button. Clicking on one of the items in the menu triggers the action. Dropdowns typically group similar or related actions.  We typically use dropdowns to allow users to select one option from a list of available choices.

## States
Dropdowns themselves have no defined stats - but their items have five: Default, hover, active, disabled and focused. In an active state, dropdown submenu items show an additional level with selectable options.
