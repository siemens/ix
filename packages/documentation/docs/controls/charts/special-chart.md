## Development

ECharts offer a wide variety of different chart types and features. The following page deals with some of the more special chart types and features.

### Interactive toolbox

Apache ECharts offers a versatile toolbox that enables users to interact with and manipulate charts effectively. By default, the toolbox appears in the top right corner of the chart. It includes various interactive tools like download, zoom, zoom reset and restore. Each has been designed to enhance the user experience. You can customize this toolbox using the `toolbox` option within the option object.

Below is an example demonstrating some of the most commonly used tools and how you can configure them.

### Advanced zoom and pan

In addition to the toolbox, ECharts provides zoom and pan functionality for a more interactive chart experience.
Users can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel, and pan the chart by clicking and dragging. These advanced features offer a seamless way to explore detailed data within the chart.
