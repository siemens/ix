# Pie charts

Pie charts display data using a circular graph. The length of each slice is proportional to the value it represents. Pie charts are commonly used to visualize the parts of a whole and are particularly useful for comparing the relative sizes of different categories.

### Pie chart example

<Playground
height="40rem"
name="echarts-pie"
noMargin
examplesByName>
</Playground>

### Donut charts

Donut charts are a variation of pie charts that have a hole in the center. Donut charts are often used to display the same information as a pie chart, but additional information can be displayed in the center of the chart.

<Playground
height="40rem"
name="echarts-circle"
noMargin

</Playground>
