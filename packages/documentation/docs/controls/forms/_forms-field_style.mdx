## Guidelines

A field is a form element when user input is needed. It's typically used with other form elements in a fieldset.

1. Label
2. Form component
3. Helper text
4. Required indicator
5. Counter (input and textarea field only)

**Note:** In this chapter, we describe the default field component. For details about [custom fields](../custom-field.mdx), refer to the [layouts](forms-layout.md) chapter.

## Options

- **Label:** Add a label for the field that provides context to your users.
- **Required:** The asterisk states whether user input is required on the field before submitting the form.
- **Field:** Use the appropriate field based on the type of input data, e.g. use [text inputs](../input.mdx) for text-based data, [checkboxes](../checkbox.mdx) for selecting from a list of predefined options, or [toggle switches](../toggle.mdx) for a binary choice.
- **Helper text:** Use to help users understand the field better. We typically use this when there are input restrictions or more information is required.
- **Show text as tooltip:** Display validation feedback either below the input field or as tooltip when the user hovers or focuses on the form field. Use a different text for the individual validation states that apply (see [validation](forms-validation.mdx)).
- **Counter:** Use a counter to show the number of characters entered into the field and the maximum number of characters allowed. We typically use it for [text input](../input.mdx) or [textarea](../textarea.mdx) fields.

## Behavior in context

- **Interaction:** See [validation](forms-validation.mdx).
- **Behavior of a field as part of a form:** See [behavior](forms-validation.mdx).
- **Text truncation:** Labels, feedback and helper texts are not truncated but break into multiple lines if they exceed the field's width.

## States

Interaction states: Default, hover, active, disabled, readonly, focus.

When a feedback tooltip is chosen over a message, the field shows a tooltip when in focus or hovered over in specific validation states.

**Note:** There are also several validation states (default, valid, info, warning, invalid) that are described in [validation](forms-validation.mdx).

## Dos and Don’ts

- Do use a label for every field
- Do use a counter for fields with a character limit
- Do use helper text to provide additional information or context about the field
- Don’t use helper text as a replacement for clear labels
- Don’t mix different variants of feedback text and tooltips
