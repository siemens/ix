## Guidelines

Effective form layouts play a crucial role in usability. Well-structured forms include fieldsets, considering the hierarchy of information, and understanding how to strike the right balance between aesthetics and functionality.

### Structuring a form

Effective ways to organize form elements enhance user comprehension and interaction within your forms:

- **Single-column layout:** Ideal for short forms with a few fields or small viewports.
- **Multi-column layout:** Suitable for long forms with multiple fields to save vertical space. Use a [layout grid](../layout-grid.md) or flexbox to align fields.
- **Tabbed layout:** Use [tabs](../tabs.md) to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Stepped layout:** Use our workflow pattern to guide users through multi-step forms.
- **Fieldset:** Group related fields together using fieldsets. This helps users understand the context of the information they are providing. Add a legend (title) to describe the field group.
- **Section heading:** Use section headings to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Blind:** Use a [blind](../blind.md) to hide optional fields and reveal them when the user selects a specific option.

### Best practice

- **Z and F shape pattern:** Follow natural reading patterns, for example left to right, to guide users through the form. Consider a clear order of fields to ensure users donâ€™t forget to fill in fields and improve data quality.
- **Button alignment:** Position primary action buttons, e.g. submit and cancel consistently. We recommend: - Bottom left: Short forms (up to 5 fields) - Bottom right: Long forms (more than 5 fields) - Bottom right and sticky: Long forms that are already filled in (e.g. edit) with a large number of fields
  %% - Top right: ??? %%
- **Label alignment:** By default, the label is positioned above its input field. Use a custom field component for long forms with a lot of fields to position the label on the left (which saves vertical space).
- **Grouping fields:** In some cases, it makes sense to combine multiple fields in one [custom field](../custom-field.mdx) with a single label that are connected contextually or through validation, e.g. entering the value and unit of an entity, selecting start and end date. It allows a clearer validation, e.g. the end date must be after the start date.
- **Field width:** Use a consistent width for input fields to create a harmonious layout. For example, use a width of 100% for full-width fields and 50% for two-column fields.
