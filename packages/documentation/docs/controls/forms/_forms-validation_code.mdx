## Development

This section details the technical implementation of validation in form components, utilizing component attributes along with corresponding CSS classes to represent various validation states.

### Validation text

- **helperText** (optional): Text displayed below the field component to provide additional information.
- **infoText** (optional): Informational text for the field component.
- **warningText** (optional): Warning text for the field component.
- **invalidText** (optional): Error text for the field component.
- **validText** (optional): Valid text for the field component.
- **showTextAsTooltip** (optional): Determines whether to display helper, info, warning, error, and valid text as tooltips.

### Validation states

To change the validation representation, you have to apply the corresponding classes to the component.

- `ix-valid`: To show component as valid (Priority 1)
- `ix-info`: To show component as info (Priority 2)
- `ix-warning`: To show component as warning (Priority 3)
- `ix-invalid`: To show component as invalid (Priority 4)

These classes have different priority levels, which determining in which order the styling is applied to the component. (`1` is the lowest priority and `3` the highest)

#### Example

```html
<ix-select class="ix-invalid ix-info"></ix-select>
```

Above example will result in displaying the component as `invalid`, because `invalid` has a higher priority than `info`.

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="You are using Angular?">
  When using Angular in combination with reactive forms, it is not necessary to
  manually apply the CSS classes `.ix-invalid` and `.ix-valid`. This will be
  done automatically through value accessors.

### Suppress internal validation

To suppress the internal validation of a component, you have to provide the `novalidate` attribute to the [form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#novalidate).

```html
<form novalidate>
  <!-- form content -->
</form>
```

### Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="angular" label="Angular" default>
    <Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Important">
      Please note that using the `required` attribute in an Angular application could result in unfavourabe behaviour displaying the field as invalid even if there was no user interaction yet.
      To avoid that it is suggested not to add the `required` attribute, but implement a custom validator for required fields instead (see `name` and `last-name` in the following code).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React">
    <Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Just an example">
      Using `react-form-hook` is just an example to demonstrate how validation could be done
      within React. You can use any other validation library or write your own validation logic.

  <TabItem value="vue" label="Vue">
    <Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Just an example">
      Using `@vuelidate/core` is just an example to demonstrate how validation could be done
      within Vue. You can use any other validation library or write your own validation logic.
