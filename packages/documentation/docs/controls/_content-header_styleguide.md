The content header provides a brief overview of the content on a page. It helps the user to understand what the page is about.
We typically use it at the very top of the page to visualize a clear hierarchy of your page.

1. Back button 
2. Content title
3. Content subtitle
4. Action buttons

## Variants
With our content header variants, it will be easy for you to achieve a well-balanced visual hierarchy throughout the page.

* Primary: In our applications, we most often use the primary variant for main pages or primary sections.
* Secondary: It is typically used when you want to provide context or actions for a specific section of a page, such as when displaying detailed information related to a selected item from a list.

## Options
- **Back button**: This option can be enabled if you want to provide a way for the user to navigate back.
- **Header title**: Here you can set your page title. Use a clear short and descriptive wording.
- **Header subtitle**: If you want to provide additional info for your content you can add a descriptive sentence here.
- **Action buttons**: Enhance the user experience by offering convenient shortcuts for actions that the user might need to perform frequently. Examples are "Add" or "Edit".

## Behavior 
- **Interaction**: The back button navigates usually one step back or behaves the same as the browser back. The action buttons typically navigate to another view.
- **Alignment**: Place the content header at the very top left corner related to the content position. Back button, title and subtitle are automatically aligned at the left side while the action buttons are aligned to the right side.
- **Cluster action buttons**: The action buttons are automatically aligned to the right. As an example for the primary content header you would have the back button, title and subtitle at the left top corner of the whole page and the action buttons at the right top corner of the page.

## Dos and Don'ts
- Do use to provide quick access to common tasks for the whole content area
- Do not use secondary content header as page title
- Do not use more than one primary headline in one page
