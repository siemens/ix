# Updating to v3.0.0

Welcome to the migration guide for upgrading from Siemens Industrial Experience design system v2 to v3. Find a list of all breaking changes [here](https://github.com/siemens/ix/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md#v300).

## Removed light and foundation Figma libraries

The following Figma libraries have been replaced by the _iX Component_ library:

- iX Component - Brand Light
- iX Foundation - Brand Light
- iX Foundation - Brand Dark
- iX Helpers

Follow the instructions below to update your Figma files to the new iX Component library:

1. On the left panel, click **Assets**.
2. Click on the <ix-icon name="book" size="16"></ix-icon> icon to open the libraries dialog.
3. Select a library you want to replace.
4. Click **Swap library**.
5. Choose **iX Components**.
6. Confirm and repeat for the other libraries.

Figma libraries for v2.0.0 are in the **Archive** project (find the link in the main library).

## Removed package `@siemens/ix-icons` from `@siemens/ix` base library

Prior to version 3.0.0 of `@siemens/ix-icons` the entire icon set was loaded into the client by default, which caused unnecessary usage of bandwidth and memory.

Starting with version 3.0.0, icons can now be loaded individually, providing significant performance optimization. To enable individual icon loading, the `@siemens/ix-icons` package now requires manual bootstrapping.

Please refer to the [`@siemens/ix-icons`](https://github.com/siemens/ix-icons) repository for detailed installation instructions. For usage with one of the framework wrappers (`@siemens/ix-angular`, `@siemens/ix-react` and `@siemens/ix-vue`) read the respective section below.

### Changed usage of icons inside `@siemens/ix-react` and `@siemens/ix-vue`

Icon imports by name (e.g. `<IxIcon name="star" />`) are no longer supported by default.

To import the icon, use the following statement:

```ts
import { iconStar } from '@siemens/ix-icons/icons';
```

Use the icon as an attribute like this:

```html
React:
<IxIcon name="{iconStar}" />

Vue:
<IxIcon :name="iconStar" />
```

If you want to use the "legacy" style (`<IxIcon name="star" />`), there are some additional setup tasks.

Create a copy task to ensure that all icons from the `@siemens/ix-icons` package are available as a static resource. Below is an example of a vite configuration (build only) example:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    copy({
      verbose: true,
      targets: [
        {
          src: 'node_modules/@siemens/ix-icons/svg/*.svg',
          dest: 'public/svg',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Changed usage of icons inside `@siemens/ix-angular`

Copy iX icons into your project folder via `angular.json`.

```json
"assets": [
  "src/favicon.ico",
  "src/assets",
  {
  "glob": "**/*.svg",
  "input": "node_modules/@siemens/ix-icons/svg",
  "output": "./svg"
  }
],
```

Then you can reference iX icons by name anywhere in your application.

```html
<ix-icon name="star"></ix-icon>
```

To load individual icons, you can also use the `addIcons` function during runtime.

```js
import { addIcons } from @siemens/ix-icons;
import { iconStar, iconStarFilled } from @siemens/ix-icons/icons;

addIcons({ iconStar, iconStarFilled });
```

```html
<ix-icon name="star"></ix-icon> <ix-icon name="star-filled"></ix-icon>
```

### Changed usage of icons in pure HTML

```html
<ix-icon name="star"></ix-icon>
```

### Custom asset path for icons

To be able to load custom icons, configure the domain of the asset path. This can either be done via `meta`-tag or with the `setAssetPath`-function.

#### With `meta`-tag

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Some other tags -->
    <meta name="ix-icons:path" content="https://some-resource-domain" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

```html
<IxIcon name="star"></IxIcon>
```

The code above fetches the SVG from `https://some-resource-domain/star.svg`.

#### With `setAssetPath`-function

Note: Call the `setAssetPath`-function before using the `IxIcon` component, e.g. in the main file.

```ts
import { setAssetPath } from '@siemens/ix-icons/components';

setAssetPath('https://some-resource-domain');
```

```html
<IxIcon name="star"></IxIcon>
```

The code above fetches the SVG from `https://some-resource-domain/star.svg`

This preloads all icons without including the SVGs as assets, which results in a larger bundle size.
Note: This approach is **NOT recommended**.

## Changed props to `@internal`

The following component members, marked as internal by comment, have been changed to annotated as `@internal`:

- `ix-menu`: `enableMapExpand`
- `ix-menu-about`: `show`
- `ix-menu-about-news`: `expanded`
- `ix-menu-settings`: `show`
- `ix-dropdown-item`: `emitItemClick()`

## Removed `Bootstrap` as a `peerDependency`

We have removed Bootstrap as a dependency to reduce the overall bundle size and to become more independent from third-party CSS frameworks. You can still use Bootstrap together with @siemens/ix, but you need to add it to you project manually.

### HTML table classes `.table` and `.table-striped` are not based on Bootstrap anymore

CSS classes are still offered to style HTML tables, but the names have changed:

- The class `.table` is now `.ix-table`.
- The class `.table-striped` is now `.ix-table-striped`.

Note: They are not based on Bootstrap anymore. If your tables rely on additional Bootstrap functionality, e.g. hoverable rows, please install Bootstrap yourself.

## Added namespacing of standard HTML elements

The prefix `ix-` has been added to our global styles of standard HTML elements like `input`, `textarea` and `label`.

This ensures that you can use other CSS libraries alongside Industrial Experience to prevent class collisions. To ensure that your styles are not broken after you update to v3, you have to provide the class `ix-form-control` to `input` and `textarea`.

The standard `label` element needs the `ix-form-label` class.

Example:

Change

```html
<input type="text" />
<input type="text" class="form-control" />
```

to

```html
<input type="text" class="ix-form-control" />
<input type="text" class="ix-form-control" />
```

## Global style updates

### Changed `input` width value

The default width of the `input` element has been changed from `width: 100%` to `width: auto`
