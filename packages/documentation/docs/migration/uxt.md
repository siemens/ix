# UXT 2.7.0 to Siemens Industrial Experience design system

For a quick and easy migration without changing your code base, the iX-UXT CSS Theme is prepared for app developers using the CSS from UXT (User Experience Toolkit, formerly named MindSphere Design System).

:::info

For the full experience, please use the Siemens Industrial Experience components. The theme is intended for a quick, yet, incomplete switch from UXT as a legacy design system.

:::

## Usage

1. When using UXT below v2.7.0, download the [CSS theme](/uxt/uxt-ix-css.css) and import it into your project.  
   _If you are using UXT v2.7.0 or higher, it is already part of the UXT CSS._
2. Apply the class `.ix` to the `.uxt-defaults` element.
3. Depending if you want to use the dark or light theme, add `.uxt-ix-theme-dark` or `.uxt-ix-theme-light` to your `body` element.

In the end, your setup should look like this:

```
<body class="uxt-ix-theme-dark">
  ...
  <div class="uxt uxt-defaults ix"></div>
  ...
</body>
```

```
<body class="uxt-ix-theme-light">
  ...
  <div class="uxt uxt-defaults ix"></div>
  ...
</body>
```

**Note**: We recommend using the CSS theme with UXT v2.7.0

Your layout might change in some places when applying the theme, including:

1. Headings are notably smaller
2. Buttons are slightly wider because of the bold label

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="I don’t see the right colors." id="colors">
1. Check if you use color variables (no raw HEX or RGB values)
2. Check if you applied the `.uxt-ix-theme-dark` on the `body`
3. Update your UXT version to v2.7.0
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My custom component doesn’t look right." id="custom-comoponents">
1. Check if you override specific attributes with `!important`
2. Check if you added the `.ix` class to the element with the `.uxt-defaults` class, as shown above
3. Update your current UXT version to 2.7.0
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The colors don’t look right in both themes." id="colors-dark">
1. Check if you use color variables (no raw HEX or RGB values)
2. Check if you used meta color variables correctly (see more details [here](https://design.mindsphere.io/patterns/color.html#tab2anchor4)):
	1. For text elements: use the font colors, e.g. color-font or color-font-secondary (no base colors)
	2. For backgrounds: use the interface colors, e.g. color-interface or color-interface-secondary (no base colors)
	3. For statuses: use the error, warning, info, success colors (not primary)
</Accordion>

## System icons

Key differences between UXT and Industrial Experience:

- [UXT offers an iconfont](https://design.mindsphere.io/patterns/system-icons.html) with 3 different styles (regular, bold, filled)
- [iX offers SVGs](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/icon-library/icons) with mainly 1 style that corresponds to our bold and partially filled variants separately

When changing to the SVG icons by Industrial Experience, check whether your stylings still apply in your custom-built components.

## Figma library

When switching from UXT to Industrial Experience, use the swap library feature as described [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries).
