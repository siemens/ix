## Clarity and contextual relevance

- Icons should be easily recognizable and understandable.
- Use icons that are contextually appropriate and convey the intended message.
- Avoid using icons that could be misinterpreted or confusing.

## Status icons

- We provide a set of standard icons to convey status.
- These icons follow a criticality hierarchy and should be used with the corresponding colors: alarm, critical, warning, success, and info.
- To ensure consistency across different applications, do not use these icons outside of their intended use cases.

## Icons within components

- Most of our components come with built-in icons or offer an optional icon slot.
- Ensure consistent use of components, either with or without icons, within the same context.

## Standalone icons

- A standalone icon, without textual description, has to be paired with a tooltip that describes the meaning of the icon. 
- Make sure a description can be read out by screen readers.
