# Siemens Industrial Experience Design System FAQs

Welcome to the Industrial Experience Design System FAQ. This document serves as your go-to resource for quick and clear answers about our industrial experience design system. Whether you’re just starting with the design system or need insights into integration and functionality, you’ll find answers to the most common questions. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, feel free to reach out. These FAQs are continuously updated, and we welcome suggestions for improvement via [email](mailto:experience.industry@siemens.com) to our support team. Thank you for choosing to use Siemens Industrial Experience Design System.

<div className="h2-faq">
## System access and use
</div>

<Accordion title="What’s the difference between the Siemens brand and the open-source libraries?" id="brand-vs-os">
The Siemens brand library within the design system is only available to Siemens employees and business partners as it contains Siemens brand elements. The open source library comes with the classic theme that can be used by non-Siemens applications. It’s possible to create custom themes that fit third-party style guides. Both libraries are available in dark and light modes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which browsers are supported?" id="vendor-support">
Although our design system can be used with any modern browser, we recommend Chrome for the best user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which device types are supported?" id="device-type-support">
Our design system is tailored for tablets and desktop computers, not smartphones. However many components, including the main navigation, are mobile-ready. We support breakpoints for the following screen sizes to ensure flexibility across various devices, even though our primary focus is on larger screens:

- Small screens: &lt;768 pixels

- Medium screens: 768-1280 pixels

- Large screens: &gt;1280 pixels
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build mobile applications with Siemens Industrial Experience?" id="mobile">
With the help of our design system, you are able to swiftly build the user interface of your mobile web app or hybrid app.
Read more on the topic in our development and UX guides on mobile development with the Industrial Experience Design System [here](/docs/mobile/mobile-app-dev).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What languages does Industrial Experience support?" id="i18n" showBorderBottom>
Our design system uses English as default, but it can be used with any language. All texts are fully customizable and therefore integrate nicely with third-party i18n solutions which means your software can easily be adapted for users of different cultures and languages.
</Accordion>

<div className="h2-faq">
## Contribution and development
</div>

<Accordion title="How do I contribute to or report issues in the design system?" id="contributions">
We want everyone to contribute to our design system and play a part in its development. There are three main ways to contribute to or report issues:
- As a Siemens employee or business partner: Post in our [Viva Engage community](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI1ODIzNzc5NjM1MiJ9)
- As an open-source library user: Contribute within the [Siemens Xcelerator Community](https://community.siemens.com/c/ix/30) or open tickets in [Github](https://github.com/siemens/ix)
- Directly contact our team regarding larger topics: experience.industry@siemens.com
For more information, see our [Github Contributing Guide](https://github.com/siemens/ix/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) which has guidance on bug reporting, workflow issues and suggesting enhancements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I request new components?" id="feature-requests" showBorderBottom>
Absolutely! Please add requests for the future in [Github](https://github.com/siemens/ix) or [Siemens Xcelerator Community](https://community.siemens.com/c/ix/30).
</Accordion>

<div className="h2-faq">
## Customization and framework Support
</div>

<Accordion title="How do I use custom icons?" id="custom-icons">
The steps to incorporate your own custom SVG icon are found under the developing tab, in [Industrial Experience documentation](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/icon-library/icons#integrate-external-icons). There is also a guide for designing new icons based on the Industrial Experience (brand) style.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can’t I customize my components?" id="component-customization">
Users are free to utilize open-source libraries at their discretion. However, customizing components may prevent future updates of our libraries from being applied to your software. Industrial Experience is built on the Web Component standard, encapsulating components within a local Shadow DOM. This prevents external styling from affecting the components, ensuring that future updates remain compatible and do not break your software due to custom styling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What kind of framework support is there?" id="framework-support">
Our design system is built with plain Web Components and is, therefore, framework agnostic. For better integration, we provide support for some of the most popular web development frameworks in Angular, React and Vue (experimental). You can find more information about our frameworks [here](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/installation/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does open source mean within our design system?" id="open-source" showBorderBottom>
Our codebase is openly and freely accessible for anyone to view, modify and distribute. We want to foster collaboration and innovation by allowing developers, designers and UX writers from around the world to contribute improvements and new features, leading to a more robust and versatile platform. We hope that this openness enhances digitalization while enabling rapid development and adaptation to new technologies.
</Accordion>

<div className="h2-faq">
## Files, documentation and accessibility
</div>

<Accordion title="Where are the component figma files and how can I access them?" id="figma-files">
[Here](https://siemens-ix.code.siemens.io/ix-brand-theme/) you will find information on how to get Figma, how to access the most important Industrial Experience libraries in Figma, and other [libraries](https://ix.siemens.io/docs/design-kit/). Remember The Siemens brand library contains Siemens specific brand elements and is only accessible to Siemens employees and business partners. For the classic theme we don't have updated figma files, but you can use the code components. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do we meet the WCAG and accessibility levels?" id="a11y-maturity-levels">
We are working towards meeting the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and other relevant accessibility standards. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that our design system is accessible to all users. While we’re still in the process of fully aligning with these guidelines, we have made significant progress and are continuously improving our accessibility features. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to achieve full compliance. For specific accessibility concerns or updates on our progress, please feel free to reach out to our team.
