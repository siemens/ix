# 3D Chart - Code

The `echarts-gl` package extends ECharts to support 3D visualizations. With this package, you can design a variety of 3D charts, including:

- 3D scatter plots
- 3D bar charts
- 3D surface plots

## Basic

<EchartsSpecial3dPlayground height="40rem" />

## Installation

To install the `echarts-gl` package, run the following command:

```sh
npm install --save @siemens/ix-echarts
```

## 3D-Charting

To use 3D charts, import the `echarts-gl` package into your project:

```typescript
import 'echarts-gl';
```

## Dos and Don'ts

- Do use with data that's best seen and interpreted in multiple dimensions
- Don't use 3D charts for simple data that can be effectively represented with 2D charts
- Don't overuse 3D charts as they can make the data harder to interpret
