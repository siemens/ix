The **ix-buttpm** component now renders as an anchor (<a>) tag when an href property is provided

- New properties `target` and `rel` were added to support enhanced link behavior
- Related components (**ix-breadcrumb-item**, **ix-menu-item**) were updated to support the `href` property

Fixes #2011
