__ix-radio__: Now doesn't change height/layout anymore when clicked. This is achieved by changing the way one of the component's divs is rendered.
__ix-checkbox__: Now doesn't change height/layout anymore when clicked. This is achieved by changing the way one of the component's SVGs is rendered.

Fixes #1702
