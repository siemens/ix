# Breaking changes v4

Here is a detailed overview of all breaking changes introduced in this major update of Siemens Industrial Experience.

## `@siemens/ix-angular`

### Update peerDependencies to v20

Projects using `@siemens/ix-angular` must upgrade to Angular 20 before updating to this version.
Some APIs deprecated in previous Angular versions may have been removed; review the Angular 20 changelog for migration steps.
Ensure all third-party Angular libraries are compatible with v20 to avoid runtime issues.

## Component updates

### ix-application

- `min-width: 0` has been added to the content-area in `ix-application` to prevent the flex container from growing beyond the screen width. If you currently have implemented a workaround for this behaviour your application's layout might be affected by this change.
