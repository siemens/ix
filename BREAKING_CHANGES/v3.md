# Breaking changes v3

Here is a detailed overview of the significant changes introduced in the major updates of Siemens industrial experience.

## Remove package `@siemens/ix-icons` from `@siemens/ix` base library

The `@siemens/ix-icons` package requires manual bootstrapping. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [`@siemens/ix-icons`](https://github.com/siemens/ix-icons) repository.

If you are using one of the framework wrappers such as `@siemens/ix-angular`, `@siemens/ix-react` or `@siemens/ix-vue` refer to the sections below.

### Usage of icons inside `@siemens/ix-react` and `@siemens/ix-vue` changed

Icon imports by name (e.g. `<IxIcon name="star" />`) are no longer supported by default.

To import the icon, use the following statement:

```ts
import { iconStar } from '@siemens/ix-icons/icons';
```

Use the icon as attribute like this:

```html
<IxIcon name="{iconStar}" />
```

If you want to use the "legacy" style (`<IxIcon name="star" />`), you'll need to do some additional setup tasks.

Create a copy task to ensure that all icons from the `@siemens/ix-icons` package are available as a static resource. Below is an example of a vite configuration (build only) example:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    copy({
      verbose: true,
      targets: [
        {
          src: 'node_modules/@siemens/ix-icons/svg/*.svg',
          dest: 'public/svg',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Usage of icons inside `@siemens/ix-angular` changed

To use imports by name (e.g. `<ix-icon name="star"></ix-icon>`), you need to add a configuration entry inside of `angular.json`:

```json
"assets": [
  "src/favicon.ico",
  "src/assets",
  {
  "glob": "**/*.svg",
  "input": "node_modules/@siemens/ix-icons/svg",
  "output": "./svg"
  }
],
```

TODO: Clarification needed if the legacy feature `preloadIcons` should be part of the PR.

To re-enable the preloaded icons you can provide the `preloadIcons` function as configuration to the module import.

```ts
IxModule.forRoot({
  preloadIcons,
}),
```

### Custom asset path for icons

To configure the asset path from which domain the `ix-icon` component will load the resource you have two options via `meta`-tag or the `setAssetPath`-function.

#### with `meta`-tag

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Some other tags -->
    <meta name="ix-icons:path" content="https://some-resource-domain" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

```html
<IxIcon name="star"></IxIcon>
```

Above will fetch the svg from `https://some-resource-domain/star.svg`

#### with `setAssetPath`-function

Make sure to call the `setAssetPath`-function before using the `IxIcon` component, such as in the main file.

```ts
import { setAssetPath } from '@siemens/ix-icons/components';

setAssetPath('https://some-resource-domain');
```

```html
<IxIcon name="star"></IxIcon>
```

Above will fetch the SVG from `https://some-resource-domain/star.svg`

This will preload all icons without including the SVGs as assets, which results in a larger bundle size. This approach ist **NOT recommended**.

## Change props to `@internal`:

The following component members marked as internal by comment have been changed to annotated as `@internal`:

- `ix-menu`: `enableMapExpand`
- `ix-menu-about`: `show`
- `ix-menu-about-news`: `expanded`
- `ix-menu-settings`: `show`
- `ix-dropdown-item`: `emitItemClick()`
