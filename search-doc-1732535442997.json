The logo must be monochromatic and cannot contain strokes as it is colored during runtime depending on your chosen theme. For Siemens applications, only the Siemens logo with the brand theme is allowed. Application name​ The application name (3) shows the official name of the application. It can be extended with additional information by using the pipe character &quot;|&quot; and 2 spaces before and after to separate both. Slot​ We use this slot to provide additional high-level information or actions and functions which may impact the application context, e.g. mode switching.

Breadcrumbs make the structure of applications transparent to users. We typically use breadcrumbs in applications that have a deep hierarchy of pages or content. This helps users understand where they are within applications, and makes it easier to navigate to pages further along the navigation tree. As a general rule, we use breadcrumbs for information architecture with more than two levels, but not as a replacement for an application's main navigation. If the information structure is extremely complex, we often consider using a tree instead of a breadcrumb. Breadcrumb items are interactive. Users navigate to their respective location by pressing the item. Each item contains a breadcrumb label. All items in the breadcrumb path are always followed by a chevron icon except for the last item. Breadcrumb itemSeparatorDropdown Variants​ Breadcrumbs are available as a ghost and solid variant. Both variants differ in font and fill color but interact in the same pattern. We typically use the ghost variant to create a lower visual emphasis for users. Options​ Icon: Breadcrumb items can, but don't have to, include an icon. The icon is positioned before the breadcrumb label. Icons can be included for each item or only for specific items (e.g. the root item).Show child items on last item: By default, the last item of the breadcrumb doesn't offer any user interaction. An interactive item variant is available which allows the user to browse to child pages of the current page. Pressing the item triggers a dropdown listing all child elements.Visible item count: By default, breadcrumbs display a limited number of items. This number can be adjusted. Behavior in context​ Population: As a general rule, we populate breadcrumbs location-based to reflect the hierarchy of the application and the location of the user within it. We always include the current location in the breadcrumb.Overflow: If the number of items exceeds the defined limit, items are hidden within a dropdown menu at the beginning of the path. The dropdown menu is triggered by pressing the respective item. The truncation is visualized with an ellipsis. The overflow behavior can also be triggered if the available space does not allow the complete display of the breadcrumb in one line.Text truncation: Truncation is applied to individual breadcrumb items if the maximum width of the breadcrumb item is exceeded.

These are typically actions that advance the user through a process, such as &quot;Submit&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Add&quot;. We use these sparingly and recommend only one per layout. These are typically called primary buttons in UX.Outline: Use for standard actions that need to be easily recognizable or for actions supporting the default (primary) action. These could include actions like &quot;Cancel&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot; or &quot;Advanced Options&quot;. These are typically called secondary buttons in UX.Ghost: Use for actions that are typically not part of the core user journey but serve specialized or conditional purposes. Tertiary buttons can represent actions such as &quot;Advanced settings&quot;, &quot;More options&quot;, &quot;Help&quot; or &quot;Customize&quot;. They may also be used for conditional actions like &quot;Change preferences&quot; or &quot;View details&quot;.Icon: Icons can also be displayed with button labels.Disabled: Buttons can be disabled (see also button states).Loading: A loading spinner is displayed on the button. The spinner replaces an icon when available.Type: A submit button is available. Submit buttons are typically used in forms and trigger a submit event. Apply this type to make a submit button more accessible. Behavior in context​ Interaction: Buttons can be triggered by pressing anywhere within the button container. When buttons are focused, they can be triggered by pressing Space.Text truncation: Button labels are not truncated. All text on buttons is one line only.Ellipsis (…): Ellipsis can be used to indicate that an action requires further input or choice from the user, such as &quot;Save as…&quot; which opens a further list of file types to choose from. Ellipses is typically not used for actions with a subsequent confirmation dialog.Alignment: Buttons can be left-justified or right-justified or fully span a container’s width.Cluster buttons: Buttons can be clustered in groups based on their relationship. A cluster can contain a mixture of buttons, e.g. a combination of a primary button with two primary ghost buttons. We recommend a minimum distance of 0.5rem between adjacent buttons, and we typically cluster buttons if actions/functions are related but not excluding each other. Otherwise, consider using a button group.Button width: Button width depends on its content. In addition, buttons have a default minimum width of 5rem to lay out common combinations such as &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; more harmoniously with equal widths. The minimum width is customizable to accommodate other combinations. States​ Buttons have six states: Default, hover, active, disabled, loading and focused. In a disabled state, buttons are visually displayed but don’t offer any user interaction.

They make it easy for users to quickly scan small chunks of information. We typically use cards to create dashboards or modular, flexible designs that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Additionally, cards can be used to draw attention to important content and serve as an entry point to deeper levels of navigation or detailed views. Cards are interactive elements. The entire container is clickable and triggers a single action. IconNotificationHeadingSubheadingExpandableContainerExpanding content Card types​ We currently offer two types of cards: action and push. Action cards have an icon, a heading and a subheading. We use them to trigger key actions. Push cards contain a notification value in addition to the icon, heading, and subheading. These cards have an expandable section placed at the bottom of the container. When clicked, the expandable section displays additional content. The notification value is logically related to the items shown in the expandable area. Push cards have a fixed content height of 11rem that cannot be changed. Customization​ We also offer a card container component that enables designers to display various types of content, such as images, charts or key data. Some small rules apply: Background images can stretch over the complete size of the container, whereas the card content must maintain a default padding of at least 1rem. Variants​ Cards are available in nine variants: Insight (outline style), notification (filled style), alarm, critical, warning, success, info, neutral and primary. Each variant emphasizes different aspects to guide the user's attention. These variants differ visually through the presence of an outline and a distinct container fill color, but they all follow the same interaction pattern. We typically use the insight variant as the default choice as we find this creates a more balanced and subtle appearance for users. Options​ Icon: Cards can, but don't have to, include an icon. The icon is positioned in the top-left corner of the container.Notification: By default, push cards display a notification value at the top of the container. This value is logically related to the items displayed in the expanding content area.Heading: Cards can, but don't have to, include a heading. The heading is aligned to the top-left corner of the container.Subheading: Cards can, but don't have to, include a subheading. The subheading is aligned to the top-left corner of the container and positioned below the heading. Behavior in context​ Interaction: As a general rule, the entire card container is interactive and clickable. If the card also contains interactive elements, the corresponding actions are triggered.Size: By default, cards have a fixed width and height. However, content overflow is not managed automatically, so the card size must be manually adjusted.Placement: We typically group cards and position them at the top-left corner of the page or content area. Within the group, cards can be organized into lists or grids using the card list component. States​ Cards can take one of three states: Default, hover and active. Action cards also offer a selected state.

We typically use a category filter to efficiently navigate large data sets, allowing users to quickly narrow their search by selecting predefined categories. It’s particularly useful in scenarios with complex data. The filter also enhances user experience by providing autocomplete suggestions and customizable filter conditions. ContainerSearch iconInput chipClear button Options​ Categories: Select these predefined groups to narrow down searches or browsing. The categories are customizable and should be defined based on the specific needs of your application or website.Suggestions: These are potential search terms that appear as users begin to type in the input field. The aim is to assist users by predicting their intended search or category, thereby speeding up the input process and reducing potential errors.Non-selectable categories: This option is useful in scenarios where the user should not be able to select certain categories. This could be due to categories that are irrelevant in the current context, restricted through user permissions or dependent on other conditions.Repeat categories: Allows users to select the same category more than once. This can be useful when users want to apply different filter conditions to the same category.Placeholder: Use to provide guidance or context to users when the category filter is empty.Icon: The default icon is &quot;search&quot;. Changing or hiding the icon within the category filter enhances the user experience and improves visual communication.Plain text: Provides the possibility to do a plain text search without choosing a specific category.Static operator: Use to restrict the filter condition to either equal (=) or not equal (!=). This is useful when it doesn't make sense, or is not applicable, to let the user decide between equal and not equal. By default, the filter condition is without restriction. Behavior​ Default: The category filter is designed to adapt to the user’s needs and the context it’s used in. As soon as the user starts typing, the filter begins to apply, narrowing down the available options based on user input. This provides a dynamic and responsive user experience.Filter conditions: These are the operators that determine how the filter matches the user’s input against the available categories. Available are equals (=) and not equals (!=). These conditions provide flexibility and precision in filtering, allowing users to find exactly what they’re looking for.Display modes: The different modes are automatically detected by the component itself. If the user enters more than one row of search terms it automatically increases the size. When it comes to more then two lines of search terms it applies a scrollbar automatically.Autocomplete: When the user starts typing it can automatically suggest possible matches. This helps with speeding up the input process and reducing potential errors.Category selection: The behavior of category selection can vary. It can be configured as non-selectable, multi-selectable or single-selectable depending on the specific application needs and context.Without category selection: Use without category selection if user input alone is sufficient to filter the data, such as when the data is not well-organized into distinct categories, or if the categories are too numerous/complex.Visual feedback: When a category is selected, it’s highlighted and a chip is added to the input field. If a user chooses to delete a category, the chip is removed and the data is unfiltered, allowing for further filtering. States​ Category filter has six states: Default, hover, active, disabled, read-only and focused. Read-only: By setting the category filter to read-only, accidental data modifications or deletions can be prevented. This can be particularly useful when dealing with critical or sensitive information that should not be altered without proper authorization.Disabled: This state is typically applied when the element is not applicable to the current context or when certain conditions must be met before the category filter can be enabled. Dos and Don’ts​ Do use if you have a large amount of content or products organized into different categoriesDo use when catering to a diverse user base with different interests or needsDo use if your content or products are organized into distinct categories or topicsDo use to make it easier for users to refine their search queries and receive more targeted resultsDon’t use if your content is minimal or not organized into distinct categoriesDon’t use if it’s not the primary method of navigationDon’t use if it slows down the user experienceDon’t use if your users are not familiar with the category names Related patterns​ Expanding searchInputSelectDropdown button","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Toggle buttons","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/buttons/toggle-buttons","content":"Toggle buttons Since 2.0.0 GuidelinesDevelopment Guidelines​ Toggle buttons are button elements which allow the user to activate/deactivate a function.

Users can hide and reveal the card list content by clicking on a control element. We typically use card lists on dashboards to show a huge amount of information in an organized and hierarchical way. Card lists consist of a header section at the top and a content section below. The header section includes an icon button with a chevron on the left, followed by the card list's label. In the content section, items of the same type can be arranged in two different layout styles: stack and scroll. Header sectionContent section&quot;Show all&quot; button&quot;Show more&quot; card Types​ The stack card list style displays content items from left to right next to each other and wraps them into a new line when space runs out. This means the height of the section can dynamically change. The scroll card list style displays the content items from left to right next to each other in a single row. When the space runs out, horizontal scrolling is enabled, indicated by a semi-transparent area on the left or right end of the content section. Options​ Label: Card lists can include a label in the header section. The label is positioned right next to the chevron.Collapse: By default, the card list is expanded, but this can be customized to suit your specific needs.Max visible cards: By default, the card list displays a maximum of 12 items.

This value is displayed on the &quot;Show all&quot; button.String - More cards: By default, the card used to indicate when there are more items available is labeled &quot;There are more cards available&quot;. Behavior in context​ Interaction: Users expand and collapse card list content by clicking on the icon button with the chevron in the header section. When the card list is expanded, content below the card list is pushed downwards.&quot;Show all&quot; button: Sometimes card lists only need to show the most important or most recent items.

Typically chips contain a concise label and sometimes an icon, and they are clickable and closable. ContainerLabel textIconClose button Variants​ With our chip variants, you can apply different colors based on their purpose, importance or context. We use chip variants to show class, status and levels of importance. The custom variant is often used for chips that visualize a high number of different categories, but does not permit color specification for hover and active states. Chip variants: Primary: For high visual emphasisState-related variants: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info and neutralCustom: For a customized background and label color Options​ Active: Specifies chip interactivity. When set to false, user input such as mouse-over and keyboard navigation are disabled and the close button is not visible.Background: Use to set a custom background color when you require more flexibility in styling the chip. Only available for the custom chip variant.Outline: Use for lower visual emphasis.Closable: When set, the chip contains a close button that removes the entire chip when selected. This feature is only applicable to active chips so users can easily remove specific chips when necessary.Icon: Chips can include an icon within the element which is positioned before the chip's label.Color: Customize font and icon color for chip. This allows users to specify a unique font color in combination with a custom background color (only applicable when the variant is set to 'custom').Width: Typically content length determines chip width with a minimum width of '2rem'. Chip width can be set to a specific value. Behavior​ Reactive: Chips react or change their appearance or behavior based on user actions. For example, updates occur as a response to system actions, providing real-time information about system changes or events.Multi-selection: Chips can visualize multi-selection and filter actions. This helps users to easily identify and understand their choices.Placement: We typically place chips inline with other objects to inform users about their state, within tables or grouped together to show selected options and filters. We do not place chips within input and filter components as these components have similar components already built-in.Dismiss: When users select close, chips are dismissed from the list or interface and are removed visually.Text truncation: When a width is set for chips, long labels are truncated to fit the available space. States​ Chips take a default, hover, focused or active state with a varying background color. For the custom chip variant, the specified colors for font and background are applied to all states. Dos and Don'ts​ Do use chips to tag and categorize so users can easily organize and filter contentDo ensure proper color contrast between chip background and text/icon with the custom variant to support readabilityDo consider chip spacing for easy tapping or selecting with mobiles and desktopsDon't overuse chips as this leads to cluttered and overwhelming interfacesDon't use different styles for chips with the same or similar useDon't use chips without any interaction (we recommend pills instead) Related patterns​ Pill","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Content header","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/content-header","content":"Content header GuidelinesDevelopment Guidelines​ The content header provides a brief overview of the content on a page.

Clicking on one of the items in the dropdown performs the action. We typically use dropdowns to allow users to select one option from a list. Dropdown containerItemHeaderQuick actionsSubmenuCheckedSeparatorIconLabel Options​ Header: Add a header for the dropdown container. This allows users to better understand which elements are in the dropdown.Quick actions: Add a quick action bar. Add 3 to 5 actions/items to the quick actions. We typically use quick actions to access common functions such as cut, copy and paste.Checked: Mark selected items in the dropdown with a check mark. We typically use check marks when an item can be activated (e.g. for the dropdown &quot;Sort by:&quot; selection: name, modified date, create date).Submenu: Add a submenu for a multi-level dropdown. We typically use a submenu when there is a long item list and different systematic categorization within the items.Separator: Add a separator to visually divide items from each other. We normally use a separator to isolate individual elements from a cohesive item list.Icon: Icons can be displayed to support the label and make the item more easy to discover by the user. The icon should be widely known for representing the action or function among your users.Label: Set a label for the dropdown item. We typically use short labels including verbs.Trigger: The trigger defines which element opens the dropdown. A trigger should also be defined for a dropdown submenu. We typically use a button as the trigger element.Anchor: An anchor defines where the dropdown is placed. When no anchor is defined the trigger element is used as the anchor.Close behavior: Defines whether a click inside and/or outside the dropdown closes the dropdown. A submenu is always closed together with the parent dropdown. Three Options are possible: Inside: clicking within the dropdown closes the dropdown.Outside: clicking outside the dropdown closes the dropdown.Both: clicking within and outside the dropdown closes the dropdown.False: dropdown will only close if it's parent gets closed. Placement: Place a dropdown at the top, bottom, left or right edge as well as at the beginning or end of the trigger/anchor element. The placement may be automatically adjusted in case it cannot be displayed correctly (detailed behavior described in the context section below). We typically use the default (bottom right) placement option to ensure consistency.Date selection: Use the component date dropdown to get a date selection in the dropdown. Behavior in context​ Text truncation: The labels of the items and the header only consist of one line. A truncation only occurs if there is not enough space on the screen.Scrollbar: A dropdown is provided with a scrollbar when the dropdown takes up 50% of the screen.Placement: The position depends on the trigger/anchor element (e.g. a button). By default, the dropdown is displayed at the bottom right of the trigger element. When there is not enough space for the selected placement, it is corrected automatically. The placement of the submenu is always generated automatically.Quick actions: Quick actions only consist of icons, therefore, it is important to use icons that are understandable without a label or tooltip.

LabelForm componentHelper textRequired indicatorCounter (input and textarea field only) Note: In this chapter, we describe the default field component. For details about custom fields, refer to the layouts chapter. Options​ Label: Add a label for the field that provides context to your users.Required: The asterisk states whether user input is required on the field before submitting the form.Field: Use the appropriate field based on the type of input data, e.g. use text inputs for text-based data, checkboxes for selecting from a list of predefined options, or toggle switches for a binary choice.Helper text: Use to help users understand the field better. We typically use this when there are input restrictions or more information is required.Show text as tooltip: Display validation feedback either below the input field or as tooltip when the user hovers or focuses on the form field. Use a different text for the individual validation states that apply (see validation).Counter: Use a counter to show the number of characters entered into the field and the maximum number of characters allowed. We typically use it for text input or textarea fields. Behavior in context​ Interaction: See validation.Behavior of a field as part of a form: See behavior.Text truncation: Labels, feedback and helper texts are not truncated but break into multiple lines if they exceed the field's width. States​ Interaction states: Default, hover, active, disabled, readonly, focus.

When requirements are not met or data is incorrect, it’s rejected. Key aspects: Data accuracy: Collect precise information for informed decisions.Security: Prevent malicious submissions.User experience: Improve by guiding users and saving time. Options​ Tooltip and feedback: See form field.Validation options: On value change (validate during input)On blur (validate on leaving a field)On blur of a certain part of the form (validate on leaving a certain part of the form)On click on submit button (validate after users press the submit button) On value change​ This option provides instant feedback to the user as they type, making it suitable for checking character rules. Examples: As the user types a password, it instantly shows whether the password meets the required length or contains special characters. With an e-mail address, it validates when the email format is correct. On blur​ With this option, validation occurs after the user finishes inputting and leaves the control. It provides immediate feedback and is commonly used for checking required inputs, specific data patterns and comparing input with server data. Example: When the user enters an email address and moves to the next field, it validates when the email format is correct. On click on submit button​ This option validates all relevant user input for completeness and plausibility after the user presses the submit button. It's useful for checking data before sending it to the server and for final validation on the server side. Example: When the user fills out a registration form and clicks the submit button, it validates when all required fields are completed and if the data is valid. On blur of a certain part of the form​ This option validates multiple input controls when users leave a specific part of the form. It provides feedback on the plausibility of multiple dependent inputs. Example: When the user completes the shipping address section of an e-commerce checkout form and moves to the payment section, it validates if the shipping address is complete and valid. Behavior in context​ Validation: A validation occurs when a user interacts with a form field, such as submitting a form or moving to the next field.Override behavior: When multiple validation states are present, only the message with the highest priority state is shown. The order of priority, from lowest to highest, is: valid, info, warning and invalid. States​ Default: The initial state of a form field, often before any user interaction or validation. Example: Helper text with password strength requirements. Valid: Indicates that the user input meets all validation criteria and is acceptable. Example: User enters a password that meets all the criteria for a strong password. Info: Provides additional context or guidance to the user. Example: User changes a field that has a dependency to another field or is not saved yet. Warning: A non-critical issue or suggestion related to the input. Examples: User enters a weak password, or a rotation speed that is beyond a safety threshold. Invalid: Indicates that the user input does not meet the specified requirements. Examples: User enters an email address without the &quot;@&quot; symbol or misses a required input.

Well-structured forms include fieldsets, considering the hierarchy of information, and understanding how to strike the right balance between aesthetics and functionality. Small form (modal)Medium formBig form (page) Structuring a form​ Effective ways to organize form elements enhance user comprehension and interaction within your forms: Single-column layout: Ideal for short forms with a few fields or small viewports.Multi-column layout: Suitable for long forms with multiple fields to save vertical space. Use a layout grid or flexbox to align fields.Tabbed layout: Use tabs to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.Stepped layout: Use our workflow pattern to guide users through multi-step forms.Fieldset: Group related fields together using fieldsets. This helps users understand the context of the information they are providing. Add a legend (title) to describe the field group.Section heading: Use section headings to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.Blind: Use a blind to hide optional fields and reveal them when the user selects a specific option. Best practice​ Z and F shape pattern: Follow natural reading patterns, for example left to right, to guide users through the form. Consider a clear order of fields to ensure users don’t forget to fill in fields and improve data quality.Button alignment: Position primary action buttons, e.g. submit and cancel consistently. We recommend: - Bottom left: Short forms (up to 5 fields) - Bottom right: Long forms (more than 5 fields) - Bottom right and sticky: Long forms that are already filled in (e.g. edit) with a large number of fields %% - Top right: ??? %%Label alignment: By default, the label is positioned above its input field. Use a custom field component for long forms with a lot of fields to position the label on the left (which saves vertical space).Grouping fields: In some cases, it makes sense to combine multiple fields in one custom field with a single label that are connected contextually or through validation, e.g. entering the value and unit of an entity, selecting start and end date. It allows a clearer validation, e.g. the end date must be after the start date.Field width: Use a consistent width for input fields to create a harmonious layout. For example, use a width of 100% for full-width fields and 50% for two-column fields. %% - Responsive behavior: xxx - Layout grid or flexbox - should I use 1 or 2 columns? %% Related patterns​ ValidationBehavior","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Group","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/group","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Group","url":"/docs/controls/group#examples","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Basic​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Group","url":"/docs/controls/group#basic","content":" PreviewAngularReactVueJavaScript  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Suppress header selection​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Group","url":"/docs/controls/group#suppress-header-selection","content":" PreviewAngularReactVueJavaScript  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Custom group entry​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Group","url":"/docs/controls/group#custom-group-entry","content":" PreviewAngularReactVueJavaScript  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Group with context menu​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Group","url":"/docs/controls/group#group-with-context-menu","content":" note Please note that there is an issue with the slot rendering that can only be fixed with the next major version of Siemens iX.

With layout grids, a two-dimensional layout system is available to create responsive layouts. Our layout grids are made of three elements: a grid, row(s) and column(s). The layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation. Commonly, the layout grid is based on a 12 column layout. Columns are nested in rows and adapt in width according to the available space. Content is placed within columns. Column widths are set as percentage. Layout gridRowColumnGutterMargin Options​ Layout grid options​ The default number of columns in a grid is 12. It is possible to choose any number of columns between 2 and 12.Layout grids contain horizontal margins. For smaller viewports or when used within a component, the margin can be removed or reduced.As a general rule, a gutter of 1.5rem is applied. The gutter can be decreased to allow for a narrower grouping of columns. Column options​ The size of a column is defined by the available space and the number of columns. If no size is set, columns automatically have equal width. The size of a column can be adjusted so that it takes a higher percentage of the available space. The size property refers to the number of columns from the default of 12 per row. Example: In a 12 column layout with 6 columns with equal width in place, each column takes a space of 1/6 (or 2 out of 12). When setting the size of the first column to 3 (corresponding to 3 out of 12), the remaining columns adjust their width to fit within the remaining space of 3/4 (or 9 out of 12). A column size auto is available. When set to auto, column width is defined by the width of its content. The remaining columns resize to fill the row.Column size can be tailored to viewports. Three viewports are currently supported. The viewport size can't be adjusted at this point. When setting the size for one viewport, larger viewports are adjusted in the same way. Viewport name\tViewport size\tDescriptionSmall\t0-767\tset columns when min width is 0 Medium\t768-1279\tset columns when min width is 768 Large\t1280+\tset columns when min width is 1280 Example: Here is an example of a 12 column layout grid with 4 columns, each with equal width. The columns' size is set to 12 and for medium viewports and larger (size md) it is set to 3. On small viewports, the columns take the full width and stack vertically. For medium and large viewports, columns take equal width. Behavior in context​ Decreasing and increasing the viewport width influences the width of each column within a layout grid. When column width is decreased to the point that the minimum content width is reached for at least one column, the layout breaks into a second line.","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Message bar","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/messagebar","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Message bar","url":"/docs/controls/messagebar#examples","content":" PreviewAngularReactVueJavaScript  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"API​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Message bar","url":"/docs/controls/messagebar#api","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Properties​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Message bar","url":"/docs/controls/messagebar#properties","content":" Name Description and specifications dismissible If true, close button is enabled and alert can be dismissed by the user Attribute: dismissible Type: boolean Default: true type Specifies the type of the alert.

ContainerIconLabel text Variants​ With our pill variants, you can apply different colors based on their purpose, importance or context. We use chip variants to show class, status and levels of importance. The custom variant is often used for pills that visualize a high number of different categories. Pill variants: Primary: For high visual emphasis.State-related variants: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info and neutral.Custom: For a customized background and label color. Options​ Align left: Position the pill content to the left side.Background: Use to set a custom background color when you require more flexibility in styling the pill. Only available for the custom pill variant.Color: Customize font and icon color for pill. This allows users to specify a unique font color in combination with a custom background color (only applicable when the variant is set to 'custom').Icon: Pills can include a close icon within the element which is positioned before the pill label.Outline: Use for lower visual emphasis.Width: Pill width can be set to a specific value, but content length normally determines pill width with a minimum width of '2rem'. Behavior​ Placement: We usually position pills inline with other elements to convey their status or category. We do not place pills within input and filter components as these already contain similar components. However, it's possible to add components similar to pills to tabs and navigation menu items. These counter or notification components are provided as component options.Text truncation: When you set a width for pills, long labels are truncated to fit the available space.

Panes have a header and a content area. When collapsed, panes are either hidden or reduced to a bar. In our applications, we often include contextual information, options, trees and lists inside panes. Panes help users focus on tasks as related controls are visually grouped and the main content has less information. They are also beneficial for compact and hierarchically organized content and provide a more dynamic layout. Left pane, inlineTop pane, inlineRight pane, floatingBottom pane, inline Options​ Heading: Set a headline for the pane (we normally use a short content description).Icon: Panes can display an icon in the pane header next to the title.Composition: Panes can be positioned on the left, top, right or bottom. We often use left panes for structuring components like trees or lists, and right panes for contextual information. Top and bottom panes are less common in our applications, but can help communicate a clear &quot;top to bottom&quot; hierarchy.Size: Sizes can be picked either as a fixed size (in pixels) or as a relative size (in percentage) depending on the intended layout. However, picking sizes only applies to medium and large screens as small screen panes are always displayed in full screen (see responsiveness below for more information). We usually choose a pane width and height that avoids the need for scrolling in our applications.Borderless: Panes can have borders to visually split them from other content areas. We typically use borderless panes when placed within layouts that already have other visual means to split areas.Hide on collapse: Define whether a pane is visible in its collapsed state. If it is visible, it has a bar appearance when collapsed that contains both the title and the expand button. We usually use inline panes with a collapsible option and floating panes without since they are triggered from a dedicated control like a button or a list item.Variant: When used within a layout, floating panes are placed above (z-axis) the main content but below the navigation menu and header. When expanded, they cover a part of the main content. Inline panes are placed on one level with the main content. When expanded, they move the main content and reduce its available space.Layout: Depending on which pane needs more focus, the top/bottom or left/right panes can use more space. Full height (left/right)Full width (top/bottom) Behavior​ Interaction: Users expand panes that are collapsible by pressing on the expand button. To expand panes with hidden collapsed state, users typically click on a button or another interactive component within the main content. They close these panes by either pressing on the button on the right side of the header or clicking outside the pane area. This removes the pane from their view.Overflow: When content extends the available space within the pane, scrollbars appear. Headers stay fixed at the top allowing users to scroll the content area. We like to avoid overfilling panes with content to remove the need for scrolling.Stacking: When users expand multiple panes within a pane layout, panes are stacked.Placement: We typically fit a pane layout within the complete content area of a page bounded by the application header on top and the navigation menu on the left.Responsiveness: On large and medium size screens, all panes have a maximum width or height of 50% of the available space. On small screens, all panes have full width and expand to full height, but the header and navigation menu remain visible. We show collapsed left and right panes on the top and bottom for a more efficient use of space. Inline panes in collapsed stateInline or floating pane in expanded stateOpened navigation menu States​ Panes have two states: collapsed and expanded. The appearance of the states varies between variants and screen sizes. Dos and Don'ts​ Do use panes to organize your content and guide your users' attentionDo use panes to display different views within a single screenDo use panes to expand/collapse content or hide/reveal contentDon't use panes for a small amount of contentDon't use panes for content that should stay visible Related patterns​ DrawersHeaderMenu","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Radio","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/radio","content":"Radio Since 2.6.0Form-ready since 2.6.0 Show deprecated version GuidelinesDevelopment Guidelines​ A radio button is an interface element that enables the user to choose only one option from a predefined set of mutually exclusive options.

They are UI elements where an event causes a small text field to appear on screen. Toasts are informative, last for a few seconds only, and take up a very small part of the screen to avoid interrupting the workflow. They usually follow an action performed by the user and provide information about the success or failure of that action. We typically use toasts for immediate feedback or tips on actions that a user performs, e.g. successful deletion. IconButtonProgress barHeaderMessageClose action Options​ Toast types: There are four preset toast types and one custom type: Info: Provides users with additional information about the performed action.Success: Informs users of a successfully performed action.Warning: Warns users of potential problems that could occur due to the action.Error: Notifies users that the action cannot be performed due to a specific problem.Custom: Adjust the icon and its color to customize your own toast messages. Header: Add a header for the toast. Use short and concise words. We typically use 1 to 3 keywords, such as &quot;Error occurred&quot; or &quot;Action completed&quot;.Message: Add a clear and concise message providing more detailed information about the toast event. We typically provide additional context or instructions related to the event, e.g. &quot;Please check your email for further instructions&quot; or &quot;Your changes have been saved successfully&quot;.Button: Include a button to provide users with an option to take further action. We typically use a button to give the user an option to undo the action or to provide a link for further information.Position: Toasts are positioned either at the bottom or top right. The default position is bottom right. This position is configured globally, which means all toasts appear from the same position. We typically change the default position if the toast covers important workflow elements. Behavior in context​ Auto closure: Toasts should only be displayed on the screen for a few seconds. A progress bar is displayed to visualize the time left until the toast disappears. We typically leave the toast on the screen from 3 to 8 seconds.Manual closure: Toasts can be closed manually at any time. It's also possible to suppress the automatic closing so that the user has to actively close the toast. We normally use a purely manual closure of the toast if the workflow is continued by using the toast, e.g. downloading files.Multiple toasts: Toasts are stacked on top of each other with the newest at the bottom.Modal vs. toast: When both the modal and the toast are triggered simultaneously, the toast appears below the modal. The toast is visible but blurred due to the transparent layer, and it eventually closes if not prevented by the auto-closing option. Dos and Don’ts​ Do use toasts to provide contextual tips and shortcuts for usersDo use toasts to instantly inform a user about the outcome of an actionDo include shortcuts to undo an action immediately after it's takenDo stick with a consistent position for toasts within the same app and avoid interchanging their positionsDon’t use toasts for high-priority or critical alerts that prevent the user from continuing their work (use a modal or a message bar instead)Don’t edit or reuse icons or icon colors from the four predefined toast types when creating custom toasts Related patterns​ ModalMessage barDrawer","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Textarea","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/controls/textarea","content":"Textarea Since 2.6.0Form-ready since 2.6.0 Show deprecated version GuidelinesDevelopment Guidelines​ The textarea component allows users to input multi-line text, making it ideal for forms that require longer entries. We typically use textareas in scenarios such as feedback forms, comment sections and message composition. LabelRequired field indicatorPlaceholderContainerResize handleHelper or feedback textCounter Options​ Label: See form field.Value: See form field.Required: See form field.Helper text: See form field.Feedback text: See form field.Show text as tooltip: See form field.Placeholder: See form field.Counter: See form field.Resize behavior: Determines how textareas can be resized (both directions, horizontally, vertically, or no resizing). Default size is 300px x 100px.Columns and width: Defines initial width by number of columns and/or width.Rows and height: Defines initial height by number of rows and/or height. Behavior in context​ Interaction: Clicking in the container enables the editing of the field.Users can type, copy, paste and cut text within textareas.Optional: Users can resize textareas to fit their needs. For example, vertical resizing can be useful in feedback forms when the entry exceeds the default height. Validation: Minimum and maximum length defines number of characters allowed.See form validation. Overflow: Text within the textarea is not truncated; it supports scrolling for overflow content.Alignment: Text is always left-aligned in textareas.Sizing: Use columns and rows when you want to define the size of the textarea based on the number of characters (columns) and lines (rows) it can display. This is particularly useful for textareas where the content length is predictable, such as input fields with character limits.Use width and height when you need to specify the exact dimensions of the textarea in terms of pixels, rems or other units. This is ideal for ensuring consistent layout and design across different screen sizes and devices, especially in responsive designs. States​ Textareas have five states: Default, hover, focused, read-only and disabled. Dos and Don’ts​ Do ensure the textarea size matches the expected input, e.g. 5 to 10 rows for detailed feedbackDo use the placeholder to give users an example of the expected inputDo set minimum and maximum character limits to ensure appropriate input lengthDon’t use the textarea for short, single-line input like name or email address, use an input field instead Related patterns​ Form fieldsValidationLayoutInput","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Acknowledging users","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/conversational-design/designing-conversations/acknowledging-users","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Acknowledging users","url":"/docs/conversational-design/designing-conversations/acknowledging-users#overview","content":" In conversations, humans like to be acknowledged to shows the other person is listening and understands the situation.

In this interaction we see a simple request for confirmation before completing the task. The chatbot clarifies the user knows the consequences and then fulfills the task.

For chatbots to recognize and establish intent correctly, they need knowledge of the user’s working environment that continuously builds as users give them input. It often requires chatbots to use follow-up questions in order to correctly establish intent and then provide the most accurate response.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Explicit vs. implicit intent​","type":1,"pageTitle":"User intent","url":"/docs/conversational-design/essentials/user-intent#explicit-vs-implicit-intent","content":" When users ask direct and clear questions, user intent is explicit which makes it easier for chatbots to respond quickly and accurately. When users ask more general questions, or even just enter key words, user intent is unclear (implicit) requiring more information. Training chatbots to understand both explicit (clear) and implicit (unclear) user intent is essential to provide effective and supportive solutions.  User intent: An engineer in a plant needs to install a new gateway    Here the user intent is explicit and clear, giving the chatbot a well-defined purpose and goal. The chatbot does not need to ask further questions and can easily and quickly provide an accurate solution.  User intent: An engineer in a plant needs to install a new gateway    Here the user intent is implicit and unclear (at the beginning). The chatbot has interpreted what the user wants and initially provided what it thinks could be the desired response. The user is then required to keep asking and clarifying so the chatbot finally understands intent and provides the desired solution. In this interaction, the user had to work to establish intent, which leads to a frustrating user experience. When we know our users and their working environment, it’s much easier to train our chatbots to comprehend user intent correctly to them the right response:    Here we see that although the intent for maintenance is very explicit, the chatbot knows to ask which day and which zones as follow-up questions to provide the most precise solution.

It is not about application icons, that usually appear on a launch pad, home screen, desktop, task bar or the like. Usage​ Icons are graphical representations of terms, functions, objects etc.. Ideally, they are used together with a descriptive text to make it easier for users to learn their meaning. A standalone icon, without textual description, has to be paired with a tooltip that describes the meaning of the icon. Make sure a description can be read out by screen readers. Icon library​ The Siemens Industrial Experience design system comes with an extensive set of icons made for the industrial context. Since it is almost impossible to cover every thinkable icon usecase, it is also possible to integrate external icons to complement the icon set. Designing new icons​ Before you start designing your specific icon set for your application, consider the following: Make sure the icons you need are not already in the library Maybe the icon already exists under a slightly different name or it might be planned for a future release so please double check or ask us when in doubt Consider using more generic icons than creating multiple very specific new ones (e.g.: Use the generic &quot;add&quot; icon instead of creating an &quot;add-wireless-device&quot; icon) Do not create alternatives to existing icons just for the sake of your own look Ask other designers within your company about the existence of an icon, to prevent creation of duplicates Finally: Entrust a professional designer with the task of designing an icon Technical requirements​ Icons in our design system are monochromatic. They will be colored during runtime, depending on the context they are being used in. For more technical requirements see the &quot;Code&quot; tab above. Formal requirements​ New icons should follow the app icon guidelines below for a consistent look &amp; feel across applications. For Siemens applications it is mandatory to follow these guidelines. Icon design guidelines​ These guidelines extend the basic guidelines on Siemens brandville. 1. Icon grid size​ The basic icon grid size is 24✕24 2. In-app icon design grid​ Use the design grid component “Icon Design Grid” from the “Assets” library as background for creating new icons The design grid helps to limit the icon boundaries to achieve an evenly optical weight of different icon shapes The clearance zone (red area) should not be touched by the icon (for exceptions see below) The lines represent the boundaries of key shapes or just mark the center Use the portrait key shape for vertically oriented shapes Use the landscape key shape for horizontally oriented shapes Use the square key shape for square icons Use the circle key shape for round icons Exceptions to the clearance zone​ Icons with attributes: Icons can be enhanced with attributes. These attributes are allowed to touch the clearance zone but should keep at least 1px space to the outer boundary Optical fixes: Shapes are allowed to touch the clearance zone to equalize visual effects with pointed shapes or single strokes 3. Light weight icons​ Prefer strokes and outlines over filled shapesPlease provide a filled variant of the icon as well, where possible and potentially useful. It can be used in situations when more visual weight is required. The filled variant gets the name suffix “-filled”. 4. Simple and geometric​ Keep icons as simple as possibleAvoid complex symbols or symbol combinations whenever possibleCreate icons from geometric shapesPrefer sharp corners and straight linesUse rounded corners and endings only to support the characteristics of the represented object 5. Stroke widths​ Default stroke width is 2pxIn case icon readability can't be guaranteed otherwise, stroke widths of 1.5px or even 1x are also allowed. Before doing that please make sure all rules from section 4 are followed. 6. Gaps​ Anti-aliasing effects can lead to blurry borders and edgesUse 2px gaps to visually separate two shapes from each otherAvoid unsafe patterns of alternating between set pixel and no pixel. In the worst case such shapes cannot be visually distinguished anymore. 7. Strikethrough, cuts and cutouts​ A diagonal strikethrough is used to symbolize the opposite of an icon or an unavailability (e.g. show &amp; hide, switch off alarm)A diagonal strikethrough starts from top left and ends at the bottom right (refers to the crossbar of letter “N” for “No”), followed by a 2px space above rightUse at least 1px space for cuts or cutouts (be aware of “unsafe patterns”, see 6.) 8. The technical finish​ Prepare your icon for integration​ The icon size (including clearance zone) must be 24x24The icon must not contain strokes (convert all strokes to outlines)Combine all icon parts to one single shape by using boolean operationsName the remaining shape “Vector”, otherwise color overrides will not work properly in FigmaMake sure the shape is set to “Scale” in the “Constraints” settings in Figma, otherwise the resizing will not work properly Integrate in Figma​ Create a component from your iconUse a short, descriptive and unique name - also consider adding a project or application suffix to the icon name to prevent naming collisions with other external icons&quot;Publish&quot; the document with your icon(s) and it will be available as library in your document assetsActivate your library in the design document Export for development​ Create an instance of your icon (this can be done in the same document the icon is stored in)Resize this instance to 512×512 (target size for development integration)Check if the scaling works properly (check scaling settings, if not)Export the instance as SVGCheck the SVG code and remove any title attributes (&lt;title&gt; ... &lt;/title&gt;) to make sure no unintentional tooltips appear on the iconMake sure the name of the SVG file matches the icon name to avoid confusionHand the SVG over to your development","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Errors, warnings and notifications","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/language/error-messages","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"General rules for messaging​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Errors, warnings and notifications","url":"/docs/language/error-messages#general-rules-for-messaging","content":" Three parts of a message: 1. title 2. explanation 3. action Title: Name which information or problem may/will occur and where it comes from Explanation: Give a clear reason for the (potential) error and explain it’s consequences if the user ignores it Action: Add clear instructions telling the user what to do next to resolve the error Do not blame the user Avoid using you and your only use passive voice as an exception Do not repeat your message in title and explanation Do not over communicate Use … to show an action is required, i.e. Fill this in… Use a polite and encouraging tone Keep it short If detailed information is required, consider using progressive disclosure button Provide specific names, locations and values of the objects involved Show urgency through wording, e.g. “immediately” only if there are serious consequences from ignoring messages  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Error messages​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Errors, warnings and notifications","url":"/docs/language/error-messages#error-messages","content":" An error message alerts user of a problem that exists and must be addressed  System error: You’re offline.

We recommend this approach for desktop-first applications.Adaptive design: There is a separate page layout for a specific breakpoint. We recommend this approach for applications with a strong focus on mobile.  If feasible, we recommend adaptive design since it offers more control over the layout and a more optimized user experience on mobile devices. However, it requires more effort to maintain different layouts. Independently from the design approach, there are different approaches to achieve a mobile-friendly experience:  Adjust the page layout (e.g. a column-based layout transforms into a row-based layout)Restructure the content (e.g. prioritize information or components differently)Hide information or entire components (e.g. less important information or components)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Interaction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"User experience considerations","url":"/docs/mobile/mobile-ux#interaction","content":" Users interact with mobile devices primarily through touch input.

This migration brings several benefits and enhancements to the functionality and performance of our library.  Here are the key advantages of migrating to Shadow DOM components:  Interoperability: Shadow DOM provides encapsulation for components, isolating their styles and markup within a dedicated DOM subtree. This ensures predictable and maintainable styling, while enabling seamless integration of self-contained and reusable components into various projects without conflicts or interference with existing styles and functionality. Improved Performance: Shadow DOM components have better performance due to the browser's optimized rendering of the encapsulated DOM subtree. This results in faster initial rendering and improved overall responsiveness of the components.  Please note that as part of this migration, some changes may be required in your codebase if you were relying on direct manipulation or styling of our components. We recommend reviewing our updated documentation and examples. This can facilitate a smooth transition so that you can take full advantage of the benefits offered by Shadow DOM components.

In addition, you can specify which layout modes should be enabled for your menu by setting the breakpoints property. For example, if you want to support only the small and medium viewports, you can set the breakpoints property as follows:  &lt;ix-basic-navigation breakpoints={['sm', 'lg']}&gt; &lt;ix-menu&gt; &lt;!-- Menu items and categories --&gt; &lt;/ix-menu&gt; &lt;/ix-basic-navigation&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Preparation for removing Bootstrap as dependency​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Updating to v2.0.0","url":"/docs/migration/2_0_0/#preparation-for-removing-bootstrap-as-dependency","content":" One goal of the Shadow DOM refactoring was to make all ix components interoperable.

To adapt our application to this, we need to set environment variables called safe-area-inset. This helps the ix-application to layout the frame of your application correctly.  --ix-safe-area-inset-top: env(safe-area-inset-top); --ix-safe-area-inset-right: env(safe-area-inset-right); --ix-safe-area-inset-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom); --ix-safe-area-inset-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);   Additionally, some variables specific to your hardware need to be set. In our example, we use an iPhone with a notch at the top. Depending on the display orientation, it's required to adjust the safe-areas of some components (e.g. ix-menu).  body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary'] { /* * If the device is in landscape-primary orientation, * we need to adjust the safe areas for the menu. * The data-screen-orientation attribute is added by the main.ts file */ --ix-application-menu-safe-area-left: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-left); }   The CSS selector body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary'] is not provided via the ionic framework. A suitable way to add it to the app is the main.ts file of your project. There are two options:  Capacitor plugin: @capacitor/screen-orientationBrowser api: ScreenOrientation  import { ScreenOrientation } from '@capacitor/screen-orientation'; async function screenOrientation() { const { type } = await ScreenOrientation.orientation(); window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type); ScreenOrientation.addListener('screenOrientationChange', ({ type }) =&gt; { window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type); }); } screenOrientation(); root.render( &lt;React.StrictMode&gt; &lt;App /&gt; &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt; );   At this point, the application frame should respect all areas of your device which are not part of the app.  Use the defined variables to ensure that the pages of your application displaying content also respect the previously defined areas as well.  .my-content-space { margin-top: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-top); }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Application frame layout​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Mobile experience","url":"/docs/mobile/mobile-app-dev#application-frame-layout","content":" By default, the Application Frame provides three default layouts (sm, md, lg) that are automatically applied depending on the size of the screen.

For example, the layout md will be applied for an iPhone in landscape orientation and iPad in portrait orientation.  Ionic provides utility functions that help to decide which layout to choose.  const ipad = [`sm`, 'md', 'lg']; const iphone = [`sm`]; let breakpoints = isPlatform('ipad') ? ipad : iphone; const Application = () =&gt; { return ( &lt;IonApp&gt; ... &lt;IxApplication breakpoints={breakpoints}&gt;...&lt;/IxApplication&gt; ... &lt;/IonApp&gt; ); };  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Animations","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/theming/animation","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"Standard timings​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Animations","url":"/docs/theming/animation#standard-timings","content":" If an animation is too slow it can feel sluggish and disturb efficient workflows.
