For avoidance of doubt, a PARTICIPATING SIEMENS ENTITY shall not be entitled to grant third parties exclusive rights to the SOFTWARE and to make available to third parties its PRODUCTS containing SOFTWARE and/or modified versions thereof under license terms that violate or conflict with the terms of this license or any applicable agreement referring to this license.

Furthermore all PARTICIPATING SIEMENS ENTITIES shall

The SIEMENS CODE REPOSITORY shall show which version of the license applies to which SOFTWARE.

### 6. Termination
